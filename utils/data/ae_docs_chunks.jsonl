You can use scripts in most Adobe applications to automate repetitive tasks, perform complex calculations, and even use some functionality not directly exposed through the graphical user interface. For example, you can direct After Effects to reorder the layers in a composition, find and replace source text in text layers, or send an e-mail message when rendering is complete. Although both the After Effects expressions language and the After Effects ExtendScript scripting language is based on JavaScript, the expressions features and scripting features of After Effects are separate and distinct. Expressions cannot access information from scripts (such as variables and functions). Whereas a script tells an application to do something, an expression says that a property is something. However, because the After Effects expression language and ExtendScript are both based on JavaScript, familiarity with either one is very helpful in understanding the other. The heart of a scriptable application is the object model. When you use Adobe After Effects, you create projects, compositions, and render queue items along with all of the elements that they contain: footage, images, solids, layers, masks, effects, and properties. Each of these items, in scripting terms, is an object. This guide describes the ExtendScript objects that have been defined for After Effects projects. The After Effects object model is composed of a project, items, compositions, layers, and render queue items. Each object has its own special attributes, and every object in an After Effects project has its own identity (although not all are accessible to scripting). You should be familiar with the After Effects object model in order to create scripts. Note  \nJavaScript objects normally referred to as \"properties\" are consistently called \"attributes\" in this guide, to avoid confusion with After Effects' own definition of a property (an animatable value of an effect, mask, or transform within an individual layer). Nearly all of what scripting can accomplish replicates what can be done by means of the After Effects graphical user interface.", "metadata": {"merged_chunks": 8}}

Nearly all of what scripting can accomplish replicates what can be done by means of the After Effects graphical user interface.\n\nA thorough knowledge of the application itself and its graphical user interface is essential to understanding how to use scripting in After Effects. ---\n\nOverview > The ExtendScript language\n\nAfter Effects scripts use the Adobe ExtendScript language, which is an extended form of JavaScript used by several Adobe applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. ExtendScript implements the JavaScript language according to the ECMA-262 specification. The After Effects scripting engine supports the 3rd Edition of the ECMA-262 Standard, including its notational and lexical conventions, types, objects, expressions, and statements. ExtendScript also implements the E4X ECMA-357 specification, which defines access to data in XML format.\n\nExtendScript defines a global debugging object, the dollar (`$`) object, and a reporting utility for ExtendScript elements, the ExtendScript Reflection interface.\n\nOverview > The ExtendScript language > File and Folder Objects\n\nBecause pathname syntax is very different in different operating systems, Adobe ExtendScript defines [Extendscript File](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/file-object.html) and [Extendscript Folder](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/folder-object.html) objects to provide platform-independent access to the underlying file system.\n\nOverview > The ExtendScript language > ScriptUI User Interface Module\n\nThe ExtendScript ScriptUI module provides the ability to create and interact with user interface elements. ScriptUI provides an object model for windows and UI control elements that you can use to create a user interface for your scripts.\n\nOverview > The ExtendScript language > Tools and Utilities\n\nIn addition, ExtendScript provides tools and features such as a localization utility for providing user-interface string values in different languages and global functions for displaying short messages in dialog boxes (alert, confirm, and prompt).\n\nOverview > The ExtendScript language > External Communication\n\nExtendScript provides a Socket object that allows you to communicate with remote systems from your After Effects scripts.\n\nOverview > The ExtendScript language > Interapplication Communication\n\nExtendScript provide s a common scripting environment for all Adobe applications, and allows inter-application communication through scripts. ---\n\nOverview > The ExtendScript Toolkit (ESTK)\n\nAfter Effects includes a script editor and debugger, the ExtendScript Toolkit (ESTK), which provides a convenient interface for creating and testing your own scripts. To start the ESTK, choose File > Scripts > Open Script Editor. If you choose to use another text editor to create, edit, and save scripts, be sure to choose an application that does not automatically add header information when saving files and that saves with Unicode (UTF-8) encoding. In many text editors, you can set preferences for saving with UTF-8 encoding. Some applications (such as Microsoft Word) by default add header information to files that can cause \"line 0\" errors in scripts, causing them to fail. For detailed information on the ExtendScript Toolkit, see the [JavaScript Tools Guide](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/).", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Overview", "Header_2": "Introduction to scripting in After Effects", "merged_chunks": 10}}

For detailed information on the ExtendScript Toolkit, see the [JavaScript Tools Guide](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/).\n\n---\n\nOverview > The .jsx and .jsxbin file-name extensions\n\nExtendScript script files are distinguished by the `.jsx` file-name extension, a variation on the standard `.js` extension used with JavaScript files. After Effects scripts must include the `.jsx` file extension in order to be properly recognized by the application. Any UTF-8-encoded text file with the `.jsx` extension is recognized as an ExtendScript file. You can use the ExtendScript Toolkit to export a binary version of an ExtendScript file, which has the extension .jsxbin. Such a binary file may not be usable with all of the scripting integration features in After Effects.\n\n---\n\nOverview > Activating full scripting features\n\nThe default is for scripts to not be allowed to write files or send or receive communication over a network. To allow scripts to write files and communicate over a network, choose Edit > Preferences > General (Windows) or After Effects > Preferences > General (Mac OS), and select the Allow Scripts To Write Files And Access Network option. Any After Effects script that contains an error preventing it from being completed generates an error message from the application. This error message includes information about the nature of the error and the line of the script on which it occurred. The ExtendScript Toolkit (ESTK) debugger can open automatically when the application encounters a script error. This feature is disabled by default so that casual users do not encounter it.\n\nTo activate this feature, choose Preferences > General, and select Enable JavaScript Debugger. ---\n\nOverview > Loading and running scripts > Running scripts directly from the File > Scripts menu\n\nWhen After Effects starts, it searches the Scripts folder for scripts to load. Loaded scripts are available from the File > Scripts menu.\n\nTo run a loaded script, choose File > Scripts > [script name]. If you edit a script while After Effects is running, you must save your changes for the changes to be applied. If you place a script in the Scripts folder while After Effects is running, you must restart After Effects for the script to appear in the Scripts menu, though you can immediately run the new script using the Run Script File command.", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Overview", "Header_2": "The ExtendScript Toolkit (ESTK)", "merged_chunks": 8}}

If you place a script in the Scripts folder while After Effects is running, you must restart After Effects for the script to appear in the Scripts menu, though you can immediately run the new script using the Run Script File command.\n\nOverview > Loading and running scripts > Running scripts using File > Scripts > Run Script File\n\nTo run a script that has not been loaded, choose File > Scripts > Run Script File, locate and select a script, and click Open.\n\nOverview > Loading and running scripts > Running scripts from the command line, a batch file, or an AppleScript script\n\nIf you are familiar with how to run a script from the command line in Windows or via AppleScript, you can send a script directly to the open After Effects application, so that the application automatically runs the script. To run a script from the command line, call afterfx.exe from the command line.\n\nUse the `-r` switch and the full path of the script to run as arguments. This command does not open a new instance of the After Effects application; it runs the script in the existing instance. Example (for Windows):  \n```\nafterfx -r c:\\script_path\\example_script.jsx\n\n```  \nYou can use this command-line technique\u2014together with the software that comes with a customizable keyboard\u2014to bind the invocation of a script to a keyboard shortcut. Following are examples of Windows command-line entries that will send an After Effects script to the application without using the After Effects user interface to execute the script. In the first example, you copy and paste your After Effects script directly on the command line and then run it. The script text appears in quotation marks following the `afterfx.exe -s` command:  \n```\nafterfx.exe -s \"alert(\"You just sent an alert to After Effects\")\"\n\n```  \nAlternatively, you can specify the location of the JSX file to be executed. For example:  \n```\nafterfx.exe -r c:\\myDocuments\\Scripts\\yourAEScriptHere.jsx\nafterfx.exe -r \"c:\\myDocuments\\Scripts\\Script Name with Spaces.jsx\"\n\n```  \nIf the program closes immediately after executing the command, you may need to remove the quotes from the script path in this command line:  \n```\nafterfx.exe -r c:\\myDocuments\\Scripts\\Script Name with Spaces.jsx\n\n```\n\nOverview > Loading and running scripts > How to include After Effects scripting in an AppleScript (Mac OS)\n\nThe following are three examples of AppleScript scripts that will send an existing JSX file containing an After Effects script to the application without using the After Effects user interface to execute the script. In the first example, you copy your After Effects script directly into the Script Editor and then run it. The script text appears within quotation marks following the DoScript command, so internal quotes in the script must be escaped using the backslash escape character, as follows  \n```\ntell application \"Adobe After Effects CS6\"\nDoScript \"alert(\\\"You just sent an alert to After Effects\\\")\"\nend tell\n\n```  \nAlternatively, you could display a dialog box asking for the location of the JSX file to be executed, as follows:  \n```\nset theFile to choose file\ntell application \"Adobe After Effects CS6\"\nDoScriptFile theFile\nend tell\n\n```  \nFinally, this script is perhaps most useful when you are working directly on editing a JSX script and want to send it to After Effects for testing or to run. To use it effectively you must enter the application that contains the open JSX file (in this example it is TextEdit); if you do not know the proper name of the application, type in your best guess to replace \"TextEdit\" and AppleScript prompts you to locate it.", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Overview", "Header_2": "Loading and running scripts", "Header_3": "Running scripts directly from the File > Scripts menu", "merged_chunks": 5}}

To use it effectively you must enter the application that contains the open JSX file (in this example it is TextEdit); if you do not know the proper name of the application, type in your best guess to replace \"TextEdit\" and AppleScript prompts you to locate it.\n\nSimply highlight the script text that you want to run, and then activate this AppleScript:  \n```\n(*\nThis script sends the current selection to After Effects as a script. *)\n\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\nset the_script to text of front document\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Adobe After Effects CS6\" activate\nDoScript the_script\nend tell\n\n```\n\nOverview > Loading and running scripts > Running scripts automatically during application startup or shutdown\n\nWithin the Scripts folder are two folders called Startup and Shutdown. After Effects runs scripts in these folders automatically, in alphabetical order, on starting and quitting, respectively. In the Startup folder, you can place scripts that you wish to execute at startup of the application.\n\nThey are executed after the application is initialized and all plug-ins are loaded. Scripting shares a global environment, so any script executed at startup can define variables and functions that are available to all scripts. In all cases, variables and functions, once defined by running a script that contains them, persist in subsequent scripts during a given After Effects session. Once the application is quit, all such globally defined variables and functions are cleared. Be sure to give variables in scripts unique names, so that a script does not inadvertently reassign global variables intended to persist throughout a session. Attributes can also be added to existing objects such as the [Application object](#general-application) to extend the application for other scripts. The Shutdown folder scripts are executed as the application quits. This occurs after the project is closed but before any other application shutdown occurs\n\nOverview > Loading and running scripts > Running scripts from the Window menu\n\nScripts in the ScriptUI Panels folder are available from the bottom of the Window menu. If a script has been written to provide a user interface in a dockable panel, the script should be put in the ScriptUI folder. ScriptUI panels work much the same as the default panels in the After Effects user interface.\n\nInstead of creating a Window object and adding controls to it, a ScriptUI Panels script uses the `this` object that represents the panel. For example, the following code adds a button to a panel:  \n```\nvar myPanel = this;\nmyPanel.add(\"button\", [10, 10, 100, 30], \"Tool #1\");\n\n```  \nIf your script creates its user interface in a function, you cannot use `this` as it will refer to the function itself, not the panel. In this case, you should pass the `this` object as an argument to your function. For example:  \n```\nfunction createUI(thisObj) {\nvar myPanel = thisObj;\nmyPanel.add(\"button\", [10, 10, 100, 30], \"Tool #1\");\nreturn myPanel;\n}\nvar myToolsPanel = createUI(this);\n\n```  \nYou cannot use the File > Scripts > Run Script File menu command to run a script that refers to this. To make your script work with either a Window object (accessible from the File > Scripts menu) or a native panel (accessible from the Window menu), check whether this is a Panel object. For example:  \n```\nfunction createUI(thisObj) {\nvar myPanel = (thisObj instanceof Panel) ? thisObj : new Window(\"palette\", \"My Tools\",\n[100, 100, 300, 300]);\nmyPanel.add(\"button\", [10, 10, 100, 30], \"Tool #1\");\nreturn myPanel;\n}\nvar myToolsPanel = createUI(this);\n\n```", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Overview", "Header_2": "Loading and running scripts", "Header_3": "How to include After Effects scripting in an AppleScript (Mac OS)", "merged_chunks": 6}}

However, a script that is busy processing a lot of data might not be very responsive.\n\nElements of basic JavaScript relevant to After Effects scripting > Javascript Variables\n\nScripting shares a global environment, so any script executed at startup can define variables and functions that are available to all scripts. In all cases, variables and functions, once defined by running a script that contains them, persist in subsequent scripts during a given After Effects session.\n\nOnce the application is quit, all such globally defined variables and functions are cleared. Scripters should be careful about giving variables in scripts unique names, so that a script does not inadvertently reassign global variables intended to persist throughout a session.\n\nElements of basic JavaScript relevant to After Effects scripting > Javascript Variables > Keywords and Statement Syntax\n\n| Keyword/Statement | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `break` | Standard JavaScript; exit the currently executing loop. |\n| `continue` | JavaScript; cease execution of the current loop iteration.\n\n|\n| `case` | Label used in a `switch` statement. |\n| `default` | Label used in a `switch` statement when a `case` label is not found. |\n| `do...while` | Standard JavaScript construct.\n\nSimilar to the while loop, except loop condition evaluation occurs at the end of the loop. |\n| `false` | Literal representing the Boolean false value. |\n| `for` | Standard JavaScript loop construct. |\n| `for...in` | Standard JavaScript construct.

If you already know about this, you can skip this section. In Javascript/Extendscript, Class Inheritance is the idea that you can define some properties or methods for a given object, and then create a *subclass* (or \"child class\") that inherits all of those properties & methods and adds more, further refining it. For example, \"automobile\" could be one base class, with \"cars\" being a subclass of the \"automobile\" base class, with \"sedan\" and \"convertible\" being two subclasses of the \"car\" base class.\n\nAny properties or methods from \"automobile\" are also accessible by \"convertible,\" because there's a direct inheritance from \"automobile\" -> \"car\" -> \"convertible\".\n\nElements of basic JavaScript relevant to After Effects scripting > Javascript Classes > Class Inheritance in After Effects\n\nAs a script developer, this is useful to know because many elements in the After Effects scripting environment follows this pattern. As a user, you can see this in After Effects layers; every layer exists in the timeline, has a Name and Index and Label Color, but some types of layers have different properties than others - for example, Audio layers can't be enable/disabled, and Camera and Light layers can't have effects. They share the base \"Layer\" features, but are each **subclasses** with their own properties. The same idea exists in After Effects scripting. Many API-accessible elements are part of class hierarchies that inherit and refine properties & methods. This lets the After Effects developers use existing structures to create new API-accessible components, and it allows script developers to use this same hierarchy to work with the After Effects DOM. For the same example above, [Layer object](#layer-layer) (itself a subclass of [PropertyGroup object](#property-propertygroup)) is the *base class* for [AVLayer object](#layer-avlayer), [CameraLayer object](#layer-cameralayer), and [LightLayer object](#layer-lightlayer). This means that CameraLayer inherits everything from the Layer object, which inherits everything from the PropertyGroup object, which inherits everything from the PropertyBase object. This is why you won't see the `name` property on the Layer page, but you can still use `layer.name` in your script; `name` is inherited from [PropertyBase.name](#property-propertybase-propertybasename). Warning  \nIn a few specific cases, properties & methods are **removed** with inheritance, not just added.", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Elements of basic JavaScript relevant to After Effects scripting", "Header_2": "Javascript Operators", "Header_3": "Description of Operators", "merged_chunks": 6}}

Warning In a few specific cases, properties & methods are **removed** with inheritance, not just added.\n\nThose cases are noted on the relevant object page.\n\nElements of basic JavaScript relevant to After Effects scripting > Javascript Classes > Checking Classes\n\nTypically in Javascript, you can use `instanceof` to check whether any given element matches an expected object type. Keep in mind that you will need to check against the *most specific* class possible; an AE Text Layer will only return `true` for `layer instanceof TextLayer`, and `false` for all parent classes (`layer instanceof AVLayer`, `layer instanceof Layer`, etc.)  \nWith that said, there exist some elements in the API that are *only* base classes for other classes; they exist to hold inherited properties & methods, but no DOM element is exactly of this type. When checking `object instanceof {class}` with these classes, AE will either throw an error that `{class} is undefined` or return `false`, depending on how the class was implemented.\n\nThe list below documents which base-only classes report which behaviours.\n\nChangelog\n\nWhat's new and changed for scripting? ---\n\nChangelog > After Effects 26 (Beta) > After Effects 26.0 (Beta) (November 2025)\n\n* Scripting methods and attributes added:\n+ Added: [PropertyGroup.addVariableFontAxis()](#property-propertygroup-propertygroupaddvariablefontaxis)\n+ Added: [Property.propertyParameters](#property-property-propertypropertyparameters)\n+ Added: [Property.valueText](#property-property-propertyvaluetext)  \n---\n\nChangelog > After Effects 25 > [After Effects 25.4](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/whats-new/2025-4.html) (August 2025)\n\n* Scripting method added: [app.restart()](#general-application-apprestart)\n\nChangelog > After Effects 25 > [After Effects 25.2](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/whats-new/2025-2.html) (April 2025)\n\n* Scripting methods and attributes added:\n+ Updated: [LightLayer.lightSource](#layer-lightlayer-lightlayerlightsource)\n\nChangelog > After Effects 25 > [After Effects 25.1](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/whats-new/2025-1.html) (December 2024)\n\n* Scripting methods and attributes added:\n+ Added: [CharacterRange.pasteFrom()](#text-characterrange-characterrangepastefrom)\n+ Added: [FontObject.hasGlyphsFor()](#text-fontobject-fontobjecthasglyphsfor)\n+ Added: [FontObject.otherFontsWithSameDict](#text-fontobject-fontobjectotherfontswithsamedict)\n+ Added: [FontsObject.getCTScriptForString()](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectgetctscriptforstring)\n+ Added: [FontsObject.getDefaultFontForCTScript()](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectgetdefaultfontforctscript)\n+ Added: [FontsObject.setDefaultFontForCTScript()](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectsetdefaultfontforctscript)  \n---\n\nChangelog > After Effects 24 > [After Effects 24.6](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/whats-new/2024-6.html) (August 2024)\n\n* Scripting methods and attributes added:\n+ Added: [FontsObject.favoriteFontFamilyList](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectfavoritefontfamilylist)\n+ Added: [FontsObject.fontsDuplicateByPostScriptName](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectfontsduplicatebypostscriptname)\n+ Added: [FontsObject.freezeSyncSubstitutedFonts](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectfreezesyncsubstitutedfonts)\n+ Added: [FontsObject.mruFontFamilyList](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectmrufontfamilylist)\n+ Added: [FontsObject.substitutedFontReplacementMatchPolicy](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectsubstitutedfontreplacementmatchpolicy)\n+ Added: [FontsObject.pollForAndPushNonSystemFontFoldersChanges()](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectpollforandpushnonsystemfontfolderschanges)\n+ Added: [TextDocument.boxAutoFitPolicy](#text-textdocument-textdocumentboxautofitpolicy)\n+ Added: [TextDocument.boxFirstBaselineAlignment](#text-textdocument-textdocumentboxfirstbaselinealignment)\n+ Added: [TextDocument.boxFirstBaselineAlignmentMinimum](#text-textdocument-textdocumentboxfirstbaselinealignmentminimum)\n+ Added: [TextDocument.boxInsetSpacing](#text-textdocument-textdocumentboxinsetspacing)\n+ Added: [TextDocument.boxOverflow](#text-textdocument-textdocumentboxoverflow)\n+ Added: [TextDocument.boxVerticalAlignment](#text-textdocument-textdocumentboxverticalalignment)\n\nChangelog > After Effects 24 > [After Effects 24.5](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/whats-new/2024-5.html) (May 2024)\n\n* Scripting methods and attributes added:\n+ Added: [Project.replaceFont()](#general-project-projectreplacefont)\n+ Added: [Project.usedFonts](#general-project-projectusedfonts)\n\nChangelog > After Effects 24 > [After Effects 24.4](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/whats-new/2024-4.html) (May 2024)\n\n* Added: [ThreeDModelLayer object](#layer-threedmodellayer)", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Elements of basic JavaScript relevant to After Effects scripting", "Header_2": "Javascript Classes", "Header_3": "Class Inheritance in After Effects", "merged_chunks": 12}}

Unlike the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument), which looks at only the first character when returning character attributes, here the character range can span zero or more characters.\n\nAs a consequence, two or more characters *may not have the same attribute value* and this mixed state will be signaled by returning `undefined`. * The [characterStart](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterstart) attribute is the first character index of the range. * The [characterEnd](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterend) attribue will report the (last + 1) character index of the range, such that ([characterEnd](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterend) - [characterStart](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterstart)) represents the number of characters in the range. It is acceptable for most attributes for the effective range to be zero - otherwise known as an insertion point. When accessed, the CharacterRange object will check that [characterStart](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterend) of the range remains valid for the current span of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument). This is the same rule as applied when the CharacterRange was created, but because the length of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) can change through the addition or removal of characters, the [characterStart](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterend) may no longer be valid. In this situation an exception will be thrown on access, either read or write. The [isRangeValid](#text-characterrange-characterrangeisrangevalid) attribute will return `false` if the effective range is no longer valid. Note that if the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) length changes, the [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange-characterrange-object) range could become valid again.\n\nCharacterRange object > Differences from TextDocument\n\nBecause CharacterRange is an accessor of [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument), most methods and attributes of TextDocument are available when working with CharacterRange.

After Effects maintains an internal font proxy to a real font which it has enumerated in the font ecosystem. As the fonts in the font ecosystem are added and removed these internal font proxies are kept in sync as well by being added and removed. The properties we report via the proxy [Font object](#text-fontobject) are the data that is available to us from the font files themselves, which of course will vary according to technology and type of font. It is not possible here to describe all the possible interesting variations and troubles that this causes us and in general it is advisable to be careful with assuming that the behavior and properties for one font type or technology are common to all other font types and technology - the answer as always is \"it depends\". A [Font object](#text-fontobject) is a soft reference to one of these internal font proxies and as a consequence is not sufficient to keep the internal font proxy alive. As a result if the internal font proxy is removed, the referencing [Font object](#text-fontobject) will throw an invalid exception for any property reference. On project open, and a few other situations, it may come to pass that the font which is being referenced in the persisted data cannot be found in the current font ecosystem. In these situations an internal font proxy will be created which will contain the desired properties, such as PostScript name, and will return `true` for [isSubstitute](#text-fontobject-fontobjectissubstitute). There will be an underlying real font which will be selected to support this internal font proxy, but we do not reveal what it is and there is no way to influence this selection. Continuing the open process with created substitute fonts, an attempt will be made to sync matching fonts from Creative Cloud Adobe Fonts. This is an asynchronous activity and the project will usually finish opening and be ready for use before any fonts are brought down from Adobe Fonts.

After any change to the font ecosystem from installing new real fonts, the outstanding list of substitute fonts will be evaluated to see if there now exists a real font which is a valid replacement for it - currently only requiring the PostScript name to match - and if one is found automatically all the references in the project to the substitute will be replaced with the newly installed font. ---\n\nFonts object > Attributes > FontsObject.allFonts\n\n`app.fonts.allFonts`\n\nFonts object > Attributes > FontsObject.allFonts > Description\n\nThe list of all the fonts currently available on your system.

{"text": "AE property of a shape layer. Use the constructor, `new Shape()`, to create a new, empty Shape object, then set the attributes individually to define the shape. A shape has a set of anchor points, or vertices, and a pair of direction handles, or tangent vectors, for each anchor point.\n\nA tangent vector (in a non-RotoBezier mask) determines the direction of the line that is drawn to or from an anchor point. There is one incoming tangent vector and one outgoing tangent vector associated with each vertex in the shape. A tangent value is a pair of x,y coordinates specified relative to the associated vertex. For example, a tangent of [-1,-1] is located above and to the left of the vertex and has a 45 degree slope, regardless of the actual location of the vertex. The longer a handle is, the greater its influence; for example, an incoming shape segment stays closer to the vector for an `inTangent` of [-2,-2] than it does for an `inTangent` of [-1,-1], even though both of these come toward the vertex from the same direction. If a shape is not closed, the `inTangent` for the first vertex and the `outTangent` for the final vertex are ignored. If the shape is closed, these two vectors specify the direction handles of the final connecting segment out of the final vertex and back into the first vertex. RotoBezier masks calculate their tangents automatically. (See [MaskPropertyGroup.rotoBezier](#property-maskpropertygroup-maskpropertygrouprotobezier)) If a shape is used in a RotoBezier mask, the tangent values are ignored. This means that, for RotoBezier masks, you can construct a shape by setting only the `vertices` attribute and setting both `inTangents` and `outTangents` to `null`. When you access the new shape, its tangent values are filled with the automatically calculated tangent values. For closed mask shapes, variable-width mask feather points can exist anywhere along the mask path. Feather points are part of the Mask Path property. Reference a specific feather point by the number of the mask path segment (portion of the path between adjacent vertices) where it appears. Tip  \nThe feather points on a mask are listed in an array in the order that they were created.\n\nShape object > Examples\n\n* Create a square mask. A square is a closed shape with 4 vertices.\n\nThe `inTangents` and `outTangents` for connected straight-line segments are 0, the default, and do not need to be explicitly set. ```\nvar myShape = new Shape();\nmyShape.vertices = [[0,0], [0,100], [100,100], [100,0]];\nmyShape.closed = true;\n\n```\n* Create a \"U\" shaped mask. A \"U\" is an open shape with the same 4 vertices used in the square. ```\nvar myShape = new Shape();\nmyShape.vertices = [[0,0], [0,100], [100,100], [100,0]];\nmyShape.closed = false;\n\n```\n* Create an oval. An oval is a closed shape with 4 vertices and with inTangent and outTangent values. ```\nvar myShape = new Shape();\nmyShape.vertices = [[300,50], [200,150],[300,250],[400,150]];\nmyShape.inTangents = [[55.23,0],[0,-55.23],[-55.23,0],[0,55.23]];\nmyShape.outTangents = [[-55.23,0],[0,55.23],[55.23,0],[0,-55.23]];\nmyShape.closed = true;\n\n```\n* Create a square mask with two feather points. A large square mask with two feather points, one closer to the left end the second mask segment (off the bottom edge) with a radius of 30 pixels and the other one centered the third mask segment (off the right edge) with a larger radius of 100 pixels. ```\nvar myShape = new Shape();\nmyShape.vertices = [[100,100], [100,400], [400,400], [400,100]]; // segments drawn counter clockwise\nmyShape.closed = true;\nmyShape.featherSegLocs = [1, 2]; // segments are numbered starting at 0, so second segment is 1\nmyShape.featherRelSegLocs = [0.15, 0.5]; // 0.15 is closer to the lower-left corner of the square\nmyShape.featherRadii = [30, 100]; // second feather point (onright-sidesegment) has a larger radius\n\n```  \n---", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Shape object", "Header_4": "Description", "merged_chunks": 4}}
