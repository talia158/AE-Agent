{"text": "A script is a series of commands that tells an application to perform a series of operations. You can use scripts in most Adobe applications to automate repetitive tasks, perform complex calculations, and even use some functionality not directly exposed through the graphical user interface. For example, you can direct After Effects to reorder the layers in a composition, find and replace source text in text layers, or send an e-mail message when rendering is complete.  \nAlthough both the After Effects expressions language and the After Effects ExtendScript scripting language is based on JavaScript, the expressions features and scripting features of After Effects are separate and distinct. Expressions cannot access information from scripts (such as variables and functions). Whereas a script tells an application to do something, an expression says that a property is something. However, because the After Effects expression language and ExtendScript are both based on JavaScript, familiarity with either one is very helpful in understanding the other.  \nThe heart of a scriptable application is the object model. When you use Adobe After Effects, you create projects, compositions, and render queue items along with all of the elements that they contain: footage, images, solids, layers, masks, effects, and properties. Each of these items, in scripting terms, is an object. This guide describes the ExtendScript objects that have been defined for After Effects projects.  \nThe After Effects object model is composed of a project, items, compositions, layers, and render queue items. Each object has its own special attributes, and every object in an After Effects project has its own identity (although not all are accessible to scripting). You should be familiar with the After Effects object model in order to create scripts.  \nNote  \nJavaScript objects normally referred to as \"properties\" are consistently called \"attributes\" in this guide, to avoid confusion with After Effects' own definition of a property (an animatable value of an effect, mask, or transform within an individual layer).  \nNearly all of what scripting can accomplish replicates what can be done by means of the After Effects graphical user interface. A thorough knowledge of the application itself and its graphical user interface is essential to understanding how to use scripting in After Effects.  \n---", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Overview", "Header_2": "Introduction to scripting in After Effects"}}

In many text editors, you can set preferences for saving with UTF-8 encoding.

{"text": "If you are familiar with how to run a script from the command line in Windows or via AppleScript, you can send a script directly to the open After Effects application, so that the application automatically runs the script.  \nTo run a script from the command line, call afterfx.exe from the command line. Use the `-r` switch and the full path of the script to run as arguments. This command does not open a new instance of the After Effects application; it runs the script in the existing instance.  \nExample (for Windows):  \n```\nafterfx -r c:\\script_path\\example_script.jsx\n\n```  \nYou can use this command-line technique\u2014together with the software that comes with a customizable keyboard\u2014to bind the invocation of a script to a keyboard shortcut.  \nFollowing are examples of Windows command-line entries that will send an After Effects script to the application without using the After Effects user interface to execute the script.  \nIn the first example, you copy and paste your After Effects script directly on the command line and then run it. The script text appears in quotation marks following the `afterfx.exe -s` command:  \n```\nafterfx.exe -s \"alert(\"You just sent an alert to After Effects\")\"\n\n```  \nAlternatively, you can specify the location of the JSX file to be executed. For example:  \n```\nafterfx.exe -r c:\\myDocuments\\Scripts\\yourAEScriptHere.jsx\nafterfx.exe -r \"c:\\myDocuments\\Scripts\\Script Name with Spaces.jsx\"\n\n```  \nIf the program closes immediately after executing the command, you may need to remove the quotes from the script path in this command line:  \n```\nafterfx.exe -r c:\\myDocuments\\Scripts\\Script Name with Spaces.jsx\n\n```", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Overview", "Header_2": "Loading and running scripts", "Header_3": "Running scripts from the command line, a batch file, or an AppleScript script"}}
{"text": "The following are three examples of AppleScript scripts that will send an existing JSX file containing an After Effects script to the application without using the After Effects user interface to execute the script.  \nIn the first example, you copy your After Effects script directly into the Script Editor and then run it. The script text appears within quotation marks following the DoScript command, so internal quotes in the script must be escaped using the backslash escape character, as follows  \n```\ntell application \"Adobe After Effects CS6\"\nDoScript \"alert(\\\"You just sent an alert to After Effects\\\")\"\nend tell\n\n```  \nAlternatively, you could display a dialog box asking for the location of the JSX file to be executed, as follows:  \n```\nset theFile to choose file\ntell application \"Adobe After Effects CS6\"\nDoScriptFile theFile\nend tell\n\n```  \nFinally, this script is perhaps most useful when you are working directly on editing a JSX script and want to send it to After Effects for testing or to run. To use it effectively you must enter the application that contains the open JSX file (in this example it is TextEdit); if you do not know the proper name of the application, type in your best guess to replace \"TextEdit\" and AppleScript prompts you to locate it.  \nSimply highlight the script text that you want to run, and then activate this AppleScript:  \n```\n(*\nThis script sends the current selection to After Effects as a script.\n*)\n\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\nset the_script to text of front document\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Adobe After Effects CS6\" activate\nDoScript the_script\nend tell\n\n```", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Overview", "Header_2": "Loading and running scripts", "Header_3": "How to include After Effects scripting in an AppleScript (Mac OS)"}}

After Effects runs scripts in these folders automatically, in alphabetical order, on starting and quitting, respectively.  \nIn the Startup folder, you can place scripts that you wish to execute at startup of the application. They are executed after the application is initialized and all plug-ins are loaded.  \nScripting shares a global environment, so any script executed at startup can define variables and functions that are available to all scripts. In all cases, variables and functions, once defined by running a script that contains them, persist in subsequent scripts during a given After Effects session. Once the application is quit, all such globally defined variables and functions are cleared. Be sure to give variables in scripts unique names, so that a script does not inadvertently reassign global variables intended to persist throughout a session.  \nAttributes can also be added to existing objects such as the [Application object](#general-application) to extend the application for other scripts.  \nThe Shutdown folder scripts are executed as the application quits.

{"text": "Scripts in the ScriptUI Panels folder are available from the bottom of the Window menu. If a script has been written to provide a user interface in a dockable panel, the script should be put in the ScriptUI folder. ScriptUI panels work much the same as the default panels in the After Effects user interface.  \nInstead of creating a Window object and adding controls to it, a ScriptUI Panels script uses the `this` object that represents the panel. For example, the following code adds a button to a panel:  \n```\nvar myPanel = this;\nmyPanel.add(\"button\", [10, 10, 100, 30], \"Tool #1\");\n\n```  \nIf your script creates its user interface in a function, you cannot use `this` as it will refer to the function itself, not the panel. In this case, you should pass the `this` object as an argument to your function. For example:  \n```\nfunction createUI(thisObj) {\nvar myPanel = thisObj;\nmyPanel.add(\"button\", [10, 10, 100, 30], \"Tool #1\");\nreturn myPanel;\n}\nvar myToolsPanel = createUI(this);\n\n```  \nYou cannot use the File > Scripts > Run Script File menu command to run a script that refers to this. To make your script work with either a Window object (accessible from the File > Scripts menu) or a native panel (accessible from the Window menu), check whether this is a Panel object. For example:  \n```\nfunction createUI(thisObj) {\nvar myPanel = (thisObj instanceof Panel) ? thisObj : new Window(\"palette\", \"My Tools\",\n[100, 100, 300, 300]);\nmyPanel.add(\"button\", [10, 10, 100, 30], \"Tool #1\");\nreturn myPanel;\n}\nvar myToolsPanel = createUI(this);\n\n```", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Overview", "Header_2": "Loading and running scripts", "Header_3": "Running scripts from the Window menu"}}

Any properties or methods from \"automobile\" are also accessible by \"convertible,\" because there's a direct inheritance from \"automobile\" -> \"car\" -> \"convertible\".", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Elements of basic JavaScript relevant to After Effects scripting", "Header_2": "Javascript Classes", "Header_3": "Class Inheritance"}}
{"text": "As a script developer, this is useful to know because many elements in the After Effects scripting environment follows this pattern.  \nAs a user, you can see this in After Effects layers; every layer exists in the timeline, has a Name and Index and Label Color, but some types of layers have different properties than others - for example, Audio layers can't be enable/disabled, and Camera and Light layers can't have effects. They share the base \"Layer\" features, but are each **subclasses** with their own properties.  \nThe same idea exists in After Effects scripting. Many API-accessible elements are part of class hierarchies that inherit and refine properties & methods. This lets the After Effects developers use existing structures to create new API-accessible components, and it allows script developers to use this same hierarchy to work with the After Effects DOM.  \nFor the same example above, [Layer object](#layer-layer) (itself a subclass of [PropertyGroup object](#property-propertygroup)) is the *base class* for [AVLayer object](#layer-avlayer), [CameraLayer object](#layer-cameralayer), and [LightLayer object](#layer-lightlayer). This means that CameraLayer inherits everything from the Layer object, which inherits everything from the PropertyGroup object, which inherits everything from the PropertyBase object.  \nThis is why you won't see the `name` property on the Layer page, but you can still use `layer.name` in your script; `name` is inherited from [PropertyBase.name](#property-propertybase-propertybasename).  \nWarning  \nIn a few specific cases, properties & methods are **removed** with inheritance, not just added.

As the fonts in the font ecosystem are added and removed these internal font proxies are kept in sync as well by being added and removed.  \nThe properties we report via the proxy [Font object](#text-fontobject) are the data that is available to us from the font files themselves, which of course will vary according to technology and type of font. It is not possible here to describe all the possible interesting variations and troubles that this causes us and in general it is advisable to be careful with assuming that the behavior and properties for one font type or technology are common to all other font types and technology - the answer as always is \"it depends\".  \nA [Font object](#text-fontobject) is a soft reference to one of these internal font proxies and as a consequence is not sufficient to keep the internal font proxy alive. As a result if the internal font proxy is removed, the referencing [Font object](#text-fontobject) will throw an invalid exception for any property reference.  \nOn project open, and a few other situations, it may come to pass that the font which is being referenced in the persisted data cannot be found in the current font ecosystem. In these situations an internal font proxy will be created which will contain the desired properties, such as PostScript name, and will return `true` for [isSubstitute](#text-fontobject-fontobjectissubstitute). There will be an underlying real font which will be selected to support this internal font proxy, but we do not reveal what it is and there is no way to influence this selection.  \nContinuing the open process with created substitute fonts, an attempt will be made to sync matching fonts from Creative Cloud Adobe Fonts. This is an asynchronous activity and the project will usually finish opening and be ready for use before any fonts are brought down from Adobe Fonts. Depending on how many fonts are being synced, they may be installed at different times. There is no way to disable this attempt.  \nAfter any change to the font ecosystem from installing new real fonts, the outstanding list of substitute fonts will be evaluated to see if there now exists a real font which is a valid replacement for it - currently only requiring the PostScript name to match - and if one is found automatically all the references in the project to the substitute will be replaced with the newly installed font.  \n---", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Fonts object", "Header_4": "Description"}}

{"text": "The Shape object encapsulates information describing a shape in a shape layer, or the outline shape of a Mask. It is the value of the \"Mask Path\" AE properties, and of the \"Path\" AE property of a shape layer. Use the constructor, `new Shape()`, to create a new, empty Shape object, then set the attributes individually to define the shape.  \nA shape has a set of anchor points, or vertices, and a pair of direction handles, or tangent vectors, for each anchor point. A tangent vector (in a non-RotoBezier mask) determines the direction of the line that is drawn to or from an anchor point. There is one incoming tangent vector and one outgoing tangent vector associated with each vertex in the shape.  \nA tangent value is a pair of x,y coordinates specified relative to the associated vertex. For example, a tangent of [-1,-1] is located above and to the left of the vertex and has a 45 degree slope, regardless of the actual location of the vertex. The longer a handle is, the greater its influence; for example, an incoming shape segment stays closer to the vector for an `inTangent` of [-2,-2] than it does for an `inTangent` of [-1,-1], even though both of these come toward the vertex from the same direction.  \nIf a shape is not closed, the `inTangent` for the first vertex and the `outTangent` for the final vertex are ignored. If the shape is closed, these two vectors specify the direction handles of the final connecting segment out of the final vertex and back into the first vertex.  \nRotoBezier masks calculate their tangents automatically. (See [MaskPropertyGroup.rotoBezier](#property-maskpropertygroup-maskpropertygrouprotobezier)) If a shape is used in a RotoBezier mask, the tangent values are ignored. This means that, for RotoBezier masks, you can construct a shape by setting only the `vertices` attribute and setting both `inTangents` and `outTangents` to `null`. When you access the new shape, its tangent values are filled with the automatically calculated tangent values.  \nFor closed mask shapes, variable-width mask feather points can exist anywhere along the mask path. Feather points are part of the Mask Path property. Reference a specific feather point by the number of the mask path segment (portion of the path between adjacent vertices) where it appears.  \nTip  \nThe feather points on a mask are listed in an array in the order that they were created.", "metadata": {"Header_1": "Shape object", "Header_4": "Description"}}
