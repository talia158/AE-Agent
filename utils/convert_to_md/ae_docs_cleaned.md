# Introduction

# Overview

## Introduction to scripting in After Effects

A script is a series of commands that tells an application to perform a series of operations. You can use scripts in most Adobe applications to automate repetitive tasks, perform complex calculations, and even use some functionality not directly exposed through the graphical user interface. For example, you can direct After Effects to reorder the layers in a composition, find and replace source text in text layers, or send an e-mail message when rendering is complete.

Although both the After Effects expressions language and the After Effects ExtendScript scripting language is based on JavaScript, the expressions features and scripting features of After Effects are separate and distinct. Expressions cannot access information from scripts (such as variables and functions). Whereas a script tells an application to do something, an expression says that a property is something. However, because the After Effects expression language and ExtendScript are both based on JavaScript, familiarity with either one is very helpful in understanding the other.

The heart of a scriptable application is the object model. When you use Adobe After Effects, you create projects, compositions, and render queue items along with all of the elements that they contain: footage, images, solids, layers, masks, effects, and properties. Each of these items, in scripting terms, is an object. This guide describes the ExtendScript objects that have been defined for After Effects projects.

The After Effects object model is composed of a project, items, compositions, layers, and render queue items. Each object has its own special attributes, and every object in an After Effects project has its own identity (although not all are accessible to scripting). You should be familiar with the After Effects object model in order to create scripts.

Note

JavaScript objects normally referred to as "properties" are consistently called "attributes" in this guide, to avoid confusion with After Effects' own definition of a property (an animatable value of an effect, mask, or transform within an individual layer).

Nearly all of what scripting can accomplish replicates what can be done by means of the After Effects graphical user interface. A thorough knowledge of the application itself and its graphical user interface is essential to understanding how to use scripting in After Effects.

## The ExtendScript language

After Effects scripts use the Adobe ExtendScript language, which is an extended form of JavaScript used by several Adobe applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. ExtendScript implements the JavaScript language according to the ECMA-262 specification. The After Effects scripting engine supports the 3rd Edition of the ECMA-262 Standard, including its notational and lexical conventions, types, objects, expressions, and statements. ExtendScript also implements the E4X ECMA-357 specification, which defines access to data in XML format.

ExtendScript defines a global debugging object, the dollar (`$`) object, and a reporting utility for ExtendScript elements, the ExtendScript Reflection interface.

### File and Folder Objects

Because pathname syntax is very different in different operating systems, Adobe ExtendScript defines [Extendscript File](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/file-object.html) and [Extendscript Folder](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/folder-object.html) objects to provide platform-independent access to the underlying file system.

### ScriptUI User Interface Module

The ExtendScript ScriptUI module provides the ability to create and interact with user interface elements. ScriptUI provides an object model for windows and UI control elements that you can use to create a user interface for your scripts.

### Tools and Utilities

In addition, ExtendScript provides tools and features such as a localization utility for providing user-interface string values in different languages and global functions for displaying short messages in dialog boxes (alert, confirm, and prompt).

### External Communication

ExtendScript provides a Socket object that allows you to communicate with remote systems from your After Effects scripts.

### Interapplication Communication

ExtendScript provide s a common scripting environment for all Adobe applications, and allows inter-application communication through scripts.

---

## The ExtendScript Toolkit (ESTK)

After Effects includes a script editor and debugger, the ExtendScript Toolkit (ESTK), which provides a convenient interface for creating and testing your own scripts.

To start the ESTK, choose File > Scripts > Open Script Editor.

If you choose to use another text editor to create, edit, and save scripts, be sure to choose an application that does not automatically add header information when saving files and that saves with Unicode (UTF-8) encoding. In many text editors, you can set preferences for saving with UTF-8 encoding. Some applications (such as Microsoft Word) by default add header information to files that can cause "line 0" errors in scripts, causing them to fail.

For detailed information on the ExtendScript Toolkit, see the [JavaScript Tools Guide](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/).

---

## The .jsx and .jsxbin file-name extensions

ExtendScript script files are distinguished by the `.jsx` file-name extension, a variation on the standard `.js` extension used with JavaScript files. After Effects scripts must include the `.jsx` file extension in order to be properly recognized by the application. Any UTF-8-encoded text file with the `.jsx` extension is recognized as an ExtendScript file.

You can use the ExtendScript Toolkit to export a binary version of an ExtendScript file, which has the extension .jsxbin. Such a binary file may not be usable with all of the scripting integration features in After Effects.

---

## Activating full scripting features

The default is for scripts to not be allowed to write files or send or receive communication over a network. To allow scripts to write files and communicate over a network, choose Edit > Preferences > General (Windows) or After Effects > Preferences > General (Mac OS), and select the Allow Scripts To Write Files And Access Network option.

Any After Effects script that contains an error preventing it from being completed generates an error message from the application. This error message includes information about the nature of the error and the line of the script on which it occurred. The ExtendScript Toolkit (ESTK) debugger can open automatically when the application encounters a script error. This feature is disabled by default so that casual users do not encounter it. To activate this feature, choose Preferences > General, and select Enable JavaScript Debugger.

---

## Loading and running scripts

### Running scripts directly from the File > Scripts menu

When After Effects starts, it searches the Scripts folder for scripts to load. Loaded scripts are available from the File > Scripts menu.

To run a loaded script, choose File > Scripts > [script name].

If you edit a script while After Effects is running, you must save your changes for the changes to be applied. If you place a script in the Scripts folder while After Effects is running, you must restart After Effects for the script to appear in the Scripts menu, though you can immediately run the new script using the Run Script File command.

### Running scripts using File > Scripts > Run Script File

To run a script that has not been loaded, choose File > Scripts > Run Script File, locate and select a script, and click Open.

### Running scripts from the command line, a batch file, or an AppleScript script

If you are familiar with how to run a script from the command line in Windows or via AppleScript, you can send a script directly to the open After Effects application, so that the application automatically runs the script.

To run a script from the command line, call afterfx.exe from the command line. Use the `-r` switch and the full path of the script to run as arguments. This command does not open a new instance of the After Effects application; it runs the script in the existing instance.

Example (for Windows):

```
afterfx -r c:\script_path\example_script.jsx

```

You can use this command-line technique—together with the software that comes with a customizable keyboard—to bind the invocation of a script to a keyboard shortcut.

Following are examples of Windows command-line entries that will send an After Effects script to the application without using the After Effects user interface to execute the script.

In the first example, you copy and paste your After Effects script directly on the command line and then run it. The script text appears in quotation marks following the `afterfx.exe -s` command:

```
afterfx.exe -s "alert("You just sent an alert to After Effects")"

```

Alternatively, you can specify the location of the JSX file to be executed. For example:

```
afterfx.exe -r c:\myDocuments\Scripts\yourAEScriptHere.jsx
afterfx.exe -r "c:\myDocuments\Scripts\Script Name with Spaces.jsx"

```

If the program closes immediately after executing the command, you may need to remove the quotes from the script path in this command line:

```
afterfx.exe -r c:\myDocuments\Scripts\Script Name with Spaces.jsx

```

### How to include After Effects scripting in an AppleScript (Mac OS)

The following are three examples of AppleScript scripts that will send an existing JSX file containing an After Effects script to the application without using the After Effects user interface to execute the script.

In the first example, you copy your After Effects script directly into the Script Editor and then run it. The script text appears within quotation marks following the DoScript command, so internal quotes in the script must be escaped using the backslash escape character, as follows

```
tell application "Adobe After Effects CS6"
    DoScript "alert(\"You just sent an alert to After Effects\")"
end tell

```

Alternatively, you could display a dialog box asking for the location of the JSX file to be executed, as follows:

```
set theFile to choose file
tell application "Adobe After Effects CS6"
    DoScriptFile theFile
end tell

```

Finally, this script is perhaps most useful when you are working directly on editing a JSX script and want to send it to After Effects for testing or to run. To use it effectively you must enter the application that contains the open JSX file (in this example it is TextEdit); if you do not know the proper name of the application, type in your best guess to replace "TextEdit" and AppleScript prompts you to locate it.

Simply highlight the script text that you want to run, and then activate this AppleScript:

```
(*
This script sends the current selection to After Effects as a script.
*)

tell application "TextEdit"
    set the_script to text of front document
end tell

tell application "Adobe After Effects CS6" activate
    DoScript the_script
end tell

```

### Running scripts automatically during application startup or shutdown

Within the Scripts folder are two folders called Startup and Shutdown. After Effects runs scripts in these folders automatically, in alphabetical order, on starting and quitting, respectively.

In the Startup folder, you can place scripts that you wish to execute at startup of the application. They are executed after the application is initialized and all plug-ins are loaded.

Scripting shares a global environment, so any script executed at startup can define variables and functions that are available to all scripts. In all cases, variables and functions, once defined by running a script that contains them, persist in subsequent scripts during a given After Effects session. Once the application is quit, all such globally defined variables and functions are cleared. Be sure to give variables in scripts unique names, so that a script does not inadvertently reassign global variables intended to persist throughout a session.

Attributes can also be added to existing objects such as the [Application object](#general-application) to extend the application for other scripts.

The Shutdown folder scripts are executed as the application quits. This occurs after the project is closed but before any other application shutdown occurs

### Running scripts from the Window menu

Scripts in the ScriptUI Panels folder are available from the bottom of the Window menu. If a script has been written to provide a user interface in a dockable panel, the script should be put in the ScriptUI folder. ScriptUI panels work much the same as the default panels in the After Effects user interface.

Instead of creating a Window object and adding controls to it, a ScriptUI Panels script uses the `this` object that represents the panel. For example, the following code adds a button to a panel:

```
var myPanel = this;
myPanel.add("button", [10, 10, 100, 30], "Tool #1");

```

If your script creates its user interface in a function, you cannot use `this` as it will refer to the function itself, not the panel. In this case, you should pass the `this` object as an argument to your function. For example:

```
function createUI(thisObj) {
    var myPanel = thisObj;
    myPanel.add("button", [10, 10, 100, 30], "Tool #1");
    return myPanel;
}
var myToolsPanel = createUI(this);

```

You cannot use the File > Scripts > Run Script File menu command to run a script that refers to this. To make your script work with either a Window object (accessible from the File > Scripts menu) or a native panel (accessible from the Window menu), check whether this is a Panel object. For example:

```
function createUI(thisObj) {
    var myPanel = (thisObj instanceof Panel) ? thisObj : new Window("palette", "My Tools",
    [100, 100, 300, 300]);
    myPanel.add("button", [10, 10, 100, 30], "Tool #1");
    return myPanel;
}
var myToolsPanel = createUI(this);

```

### Stopping a running script

A script can be stopped by pressing Esc or Cmd+period (in Mac OS) when the After Effects or the script's user interface has focus. However, a script that is busy processing a lot of data might not be very responsive.

# Elements of basic JavaScript relevant to After Effects scripting

## Javascript Variables

Scripting shares a global environment, so any script executed at startup can define variables and functions that are available to all scripts. In all cases, variables and functions, once defined by running a script that contains them, persist in subsequent scripts during a given After Effects session. Once the application is quit, all such globally defined variables and functions are cleared. Scripters should be careful about giving variables in scripts unique names, so that a script does not inadvertently reassign global variables intended to persist throughout a session.

## Javascript Classes

### Class Inheritance

This is section gives you a brief overview in oriented programming and inheritance. If you already know about this, you can skip this section.

In Javascript/Extendscript, Class Inheritance is the idea that you can define some properties or methods for a given object, and then create a *subclass* (or "child class") that inherits all of those properties & methods and adds more, further refining it.

For example, "automobile" could be one base class, with "cars" being a subclass of the "automobile" base class, with "sedan" and "convertible" being two subclasses of the "car" base class. Any properties or methods from "automobile" are also accessible by "convertible," because there's a direct inheritance from "automobile" -> "car" -> "convertible".

### Class Inheritance in After Effects

As a script developer, this is useful to know because many elements in the After Effects scripting environment follows this pattern.

As a user, you can see this in After Effects layers; every layer exists in the timeline, has a Name and Index and Label Color, but some types of layers have different properties than others - for example, Audio layers can't be enable/disabled, and Camera and Light layers can't have effects. They share the base "Layer" features, but are each **subclasses** with their own properties.

The same idea exists in After Effects scripting. Many API-accessible elements are part of class hierarchies that inherit and refine properties & methods. This lets the After Effects developers use existing structures to create new API-accessible components, and it allows script developers to use this same hierarchy to work with the After Effects DOM.

For the same example above, [Layer object](#layer-layer) (itself a subclass of [PropertyGroup object](#property-propertygroup)) is the *base class* for [AVLayer object](#layer-avlayer), [CameraLayer object](#layer-cameralayer), and [LightLayer object](#layer-lightlayer). This means that CameraLayer inherits everything from the Layer object, which inherits everything from the PropertyGroup object, which inherits everything from the PropertyBase object.

This is why you won't see the `name` property on the Layer page, but you can still use `layer.name` in your script; `name` is inherited from [PropertyBase.name](#property-propertybase-propertybasename).

Warning

In a few specific cases, properties & methods are **removed** with inheritance, not just added. Those cases are noted on the relevant object page.

### Checking Classes

Typically in Javascript, you can use `instanceof` to check whether any given element matches an expected object type.

Keep in mind that you will need to check against the *most specific* class possible; an AE Text Layer will only return `true` for `layer instanceof TextLayer`, and `false` for all parent classes (`layer instanceof AVLayer`, `layer instanceof Layer`, etc.)

With that said, there exist some elements in the API that are *only* base classes for other classes; they exist to hold inherited properties & methods, but no DOM element is exactly of this type.

When checking `object instanceof {class}` with these classes, AE will either throw an error that `{class} is undefined` or return `false`, depending on how the class was implemented. The list below documents which base-only classes report which behaviours.

# The After Effects Object Model

As you look through this reference section, which is organized alphabetically by object, you can refer to the following diagrams for an overview of where the various objects fall within the hierarchy, and their correspondence to the user interface.

![After Effects Object Model](../_static/objectmodel.png "After Effects Object Model")
*Hierarchy diagram of the main After Effects scripting objects*

Note that the [Extendscript File](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/file-object.html), Folder, and Socket objects are defined by ExtendScript, and are documented in the [JavaScript Tools Guide](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/).

ExtendScript also defines the ScriptUI module, a set of window and user-interface control objects, which are available to After Effects scripts. These are also documented in the [JavaScript Tools Guide](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/).

The hierarchy of objects in scripting corresponds to the hierarchy in the user interface.

![After Effects User Interface](../_static/application.png "After Effects User Interface")

The application contains a Project panel, which displays a project. The project contains compositions, which contain layers. The source for a layer can be a footage file, placeholder, or solid, also listed in the Project panel. Each layer contains settings known as properties, and these can contain markers and keyframes. The renderqueue contains render-queue items as well as render settings and output modules. All of these entities are represented by objects in scripting.

Note

To avoid ambiguity, this manual uses the term "attribute" to refer to JavaScript object properties, and the term "property" or "AE property" to refer to After Effects layer properties.

#### Object summary

The following table lists all objects alphabetically, with links to the documentation page for each.

| Object | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Global functions](#general-globals) | Globally available functions that allow you to display text for script debugging purposes, and help convert time values between seconds and frames. |
| [Application object](#general-application) | A single global object, available by its name (app), that provides access to objects and application settings within the After Effects application. |
| [AVItem object](#item-avitem) | Represents audio/visual files imported into After Effects. |
| [AVLayer object](#layer-avlayer) | Represents those layers that contain AVItem objects (composition layers, footage layers, solid layers, text layers, and sound layers). |
| [CameraLayer object](#layer-cameralayer) | Represents a camera layer within a composition. |
| [Collection object](#other-collection) | Associates a set of objects or values as a logical group and provides access to them by index. |
| [CompItem object](#item-compitem) | Represents a composition, and allows you to manipulate it and get information about it. |
| [FileSource object](#sources-filesource) | Describes footage that comes from a file. |
| [FolderItem object](#item-folderitem) | Represents a folder in the Project panel. |
| [FootageItem object](#item-footageitem) | Represents a footage item imported into a project, which appears in the Project panel. |
| [FootageSource object](#sources-footagesource) | Describes the file source of some footage. |
| [ImportOptions object](#other-importoptions) | Encapsulates options for importing files into After Effects. |
| [Item object](#item-item) | Represents an item in a project that appears in the Project panel. |
| [ItemCollection object](#item-itemcollection) | Collects items in a project. |
| [KeyframeEase object](#other-keyframeease) | Encapsulates keyframe ease values in an After Effects property. |
| [Layer object](#layer-layer) | A base class for layer classes. |

# After Effects Class Hierarchy

This section lists the class hierarchies for relevant AE API elements. For a primer on what this means, see [Javascript Classes](#introduction-javascript-javascript-classes)

When using this guide, any objects that exist as part of a class hierarchy will note whether they exist as a subclass or base class (or both) of another object.

As it can be useful to see all available class hierarchies in one place, we've created this list below.

Note that some classes exist only as base classes, and demonstrate unexpected behaviour when type checking via `instanceof`, as noted in the table below. Classes with no symbol behave as expected.

#### Symbol Legend

| Symbol | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| ⚠ | `instanceof` is always `false` |
| ❌ | Class is undefined; `instanceof` will throw an error |

# General

# Global functions

#### Description

These globally available functions that are specific to After Effects. Any JavaScript object or function can call these functions, which allow you to display text in a small (3-line) area of the Info panel, to convert numeric time values to and from string values, or to generate a random number.

| Global function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `clearOutput()` | Clears text from the Info panel. |
| `currentFormatToTime()` | Converts string time value to a numeric time value. |
| `generateRandomNumber()` | Generates a random number. |
| `getEnumAsString()` | Converts an Enum value to it's string name. |
| `timeToCurrentFormat()` | Converts a numeric time value to a string time value. |
| `write()` | Writes text to the Info panel, with no line break added. |
| `writeLn()` | Writes text to the Info panel, adding a line break at the end. |
| `isValid()` | When `true`, the specified object exists. |

Additional global functions for standard user I/O (`alert`, `confirm` , and `prompt`) and static functions for file I/O, are defined by ExtendScript; for detailed reference information, see the [JavaScript Tools Guide](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/).

---

## Methods

### clearOutput()

`clearOutput()`

#### Description

Clears the output in the Info panel.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### currentFormatToTime()

`currentFormatToTime(formattedTime, fps[, isDuration])`

#### Description

Converts a formatted string for a frame time value to a number of seconds, given a specified frame rate. For example, if the formatted frame time value is 0:00:12 (the exact string format is determined by a project setting), and the frame rate is 24 fps, the time would be 0.5 seconds (12/24). If the frame rate is 30 fps, the time would be 0.4 seconds (12/30). If the time is a duration, the frames are counted from 0. Otherwise, the frames are counted from the project's starting frame (see [Project.displayStartFrame](#general-project-projectdisplaystartframe)).

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `formattedTime` | The frame time value, a string specifying a number of frames in the project's current time display format. |
| `fps` | The frames-per-second, a floating-point value. |
| `isDuration` | Optional. When `true`, the time is a duration (measured from frame 0). When `false` (the default), the time is measured from the project's starting frame. |

#### Returns

Floating-point value, the number of seconds.

---

### generateRandomNumber()

`generateRandomNumber()`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 13.6 (CC 2015)

#### Description

Generates random numbers. This function is recommended instead of `Math.random()` for generating random numbers that will be applied as values in a project (e.g., when using setValue).

This method avoids a problem where `Math.random()` would not return random values in After Effects CC 2015 (13.5.x) due to a concurrency issue with multiple CPU threads.

#### Returns

Floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range `[0..1]`.

#### Example

```
// change the position X of all layers with random number

var myComp = app.project.activeItem;
var x = 0;

for (var i = 1; i <= myComp.numLayers; i++) {
    // If you use Math.random(), this does not work
    // x = 400 * (Math.random()) - 200;
    // use new generateRandomNumber() instead

    x = 400 * generateRandomNumber() - 200;
    var currentPos = myComp.layer(i).property("Position").value;
    myComp.layer(i).property("Position").setValue([currentPos[0] + x, currentPos[1]]);
}

```

---

### getEnumAsString()

`getEnumAsString()`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.0

#### Description

Returns the string value of an Enum.

#### Parameters

Enum.

#### Returns

String.

#### Example

```
// Returns: "BlendingMode.ADD"
alert(getEnumAsString(5220));

```

---

### isValid()

`isValid(obj)`

#### Description

Determines if the specified After Effects object (e.g., composition, layer, mask, etc.) still exists. Some operations, such as [PropertyBase.moveTo()](#property-propertybase-propertybasemoveto), might invalidate existing variable assignments to related objects. This function allows you to test whether those assignments are still valid before attempting to access them.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `obj` | The After Effects object to check for validity. |

#### Returns

Boolean.

#### Example

```
var layer = app.project.activeItem.layer(1); // assume layer has three masks
alert(isValid(layer)); // displays "true"
var mask1 = layer.mask(1);
var mask2 = layer.mask(2);
var mask3 = layer.mask(3);
mask3.moveTo(1); // move the third mask to the top of the mask stack
alert(isValid(mask1)); // displays "false"; mask2 and mask3 do as well

```

---

### timeToCurrentFormat()

`timeToCurrentFormat(time, fps[, isDuration])`

#### Description

Converts a numeric time value (a number of seconds) to a frame time value; that is, a formatted string thatshows which frame corresponds to that time, at the specified rate. For example, if the time is 0.5 seconds, andthe frame rate is 24 fps, the frame would be 0:00:12 (when the project is set to display as timecode). If the framerate is 30 fps, the frame would be 0:00:15. The format of the timecode string is determined by a project setting. If the time is a duration, the frames are counted from 0. Otherwise, the frames are counted from the project's starting frame (see [Project displayStartFrame](#general-project-projectdisplaystartframe) attribute).

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `time` | The number of seconds, a floating-point value. |
| `fps` | The frames-per-second, a floating-point value. |
| `isDuration` | Optional. When `true`, the time is a duration (measured from frame 0). When `false` (the default), the time is measured from the project's starting frame. |

#### Returns

String in the project's current time display format.

---

### write()

`write(text)`

#### Description

Writes output to the Info panel, with no line break added.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | The string to display. Truncated if too long for the Info panel. |

#### Returns

Nothing.

#### Example

```
write("This text appears in Info panel ");
write("with more on same line.");

```

---

### writeLn()

`writeLn(text)`

#### Description

Writes output to the Info panel and adds a line break at the end.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | The string to display. |

#### Returns

Nothing.

#### Example

```
writeLn("This text appears on first line");
writeLn("This text appears on second line");

```

#### Description

Opens the application main window if it is minimized or iconified, and brings it to the front of the desktop.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### app.beginSuppressDialogs()

### app.beginUndoGroup()

`app.beginUndoGroup(undoString)`

#### Description

Marks the beginning of an undo group, which allows a script to logically group all of its actions as a single undoable action (for use with the Edit > Undo/Redo menu items). Use the [app.endUndoGroup()](#general-application-appendundogroup) method to mark the end of the group.

`beginUndoGroup()` and `endUndoGroup()` pairs can be nested. Groups within groups become part of the larger group, and will undo correctly. In this case, the names of inner groups are ignored.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `undoString` | String | The text that will appear for the Undo command in the Edit menu (that is, "Undo") |

#### Returns

Nothing.

### app.endSuppressDialogs()

`app.endSuppressDialogs(alert)`

#### Description

Ends the suppression of script error dialog boxes in the user interface. Error dialogs are displayed by default;call this method only if [app.beginSuppressDialogs()](#general-application-appbeginsuppressdialogs) has previously been called.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alert` | Boolean | When `true`, errors that have occurred following the call to `beginSuppressDialogs()` are displayed in a dialog box. |

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### app.endUndoGroup()

`app.endUndoGroup()`

#### Description

Marks the end of an undo group begun with the [app.beginUndoGroup()](#general-application-appbeginundogroup) method. You can use this method to place an end to an undo group in the middle of a script, should you wish to use more than one undo group for a single script. If you are using only a single undo group for a given script, you do not need to use this method; in its absence at the end of a script, the system will close the undo group automatically. Calling this method without having set a `beginUndoGroup()` method yields an error.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### app.endWatchFolder()

### Project.replaceFont()

`app.project.replaceFont(fromFont, toFont, [noFontLocking = false])`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.5

#### Description

This function will replace all the usages of [Font object](#text-fontobject) `fromFont` with [Font object](#text-fontobject) `toFont`.

This operation exposes the same mechanism and policy used for automatic font replacement of missing or substituted fonts and is therefore a complete and precise replacement, even on [TextDocuments](#text-textdocument) which have mixed styling, preserving the character range the `fromFont` was applied to.

This operation is not undoable.

The optional parameter `noFontLocking` controls what happens when the `toFont` has no glyphs for the text it is applied to. By default a fallback font will be selected which will have the necessary glyphs, but if this parameter is set to `true` then this fallback will not take place and missing glyphs will result. There is no way at the current time to detect or report this.

Note that when `fromFont` is a substituted font and the `toFont` has the same font properties no fallback can occur and the parameter is ignored and treated as `true`.

```
var fromFont = app.project.usedFonts[0].font;
var fontList = app.fonts.getFontsByPostScriptName("TimesNewRomanPSMT");
var toFont = fontList[0];
var layerChanged = app.project.replaceFont(fromFont, toFont);

```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fromFont` | [Font object](#text-fontobject) | Font to be replaced. |
| `toFont` | [Font object](#text-fontobject) | Font to replace it with. |
| `noFontLocking` | Boolean | Optional. Defaults to `false` |

#### Returns

Boolean. `true` if at least one Layer was changed.

---

### Project.save()

`app.project.save([file])`

#### Description

Saves the project. The same as the File > Save or File > Save As command. If the project has never previously been saved and no file is specified, prompts the user for a location and file name.

Pass a [File](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/file-object.html) object to save a project to a new file without prompting.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | [Extendscript File](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/file-object.html) | Optional. The file to save. |

#### Returns

None.

---

### Project.saveWithDialog()

`app.project.saveWithDialog()`

#### Description

Shows the Save dialog box. The user can name a file with a location and save the project, or click Cancel to exit the dialog box.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Boolean; `true` if the project was saved.

---

### Project.setDefaultImportFolder()

`app.project.setDefaultImportFolder(folder)`

#### Description

Sets the folder that will be shown in the file import dialog. This location will be used as an override until setDefaultImportFolder() is called with no parameters, or until After Effects is quit.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `folder` | [Extendscript Folder](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/folder-object.html) | Folder to set as default |

#### Returns

Boolean; indicates if the operation was successful.

#### Examples

Any of the following will set the default import folder to C:/My Folder:

* `var myFolder = new Folder("C:/My Folder"); app.project.setDefaultImportFolder(myFolder);`
* `app.project.setDefaultImportFolder(new Folder("C:/My Folder"));`
* `app.project.setDefaultImportFolder(Folder("C:/My Folder"));`

Note: if the path refers to an existing file and not a folder, the Folder function returns a File object instead of a Folder object, which will cause `setDefaultImportFolder()` to return `false`.

To set the default import folder to the current user's desktop folder: `app.project.setDefaultImportFolder(Folder.desktop);`

To disable the default folder, call `setDefaultImportFolder()` with no parameters: `app.project.setDefaultImportFolder();`

---

### Project.showWindow()

`app.project.showWindow(doShow)`

#### Description

# Item

# Item object

`app.project.item(index)`

`app.project.items[index]`

#### Description

The Item object represents an item that can appear in the Project panel. The first item is at index 1.

Info

Item is the base class for [AVItem object](#item-avitem) and for [FolderItem object](#item-folderitem), which are in turn the base classes for various other item types, so Item attributes and methods are available when working with all of these item types.

#### Example

This example gets the second item from the project and checks that it is a folder. It then removes from the folder any top-level item that is not currently selected. It also checks to make sure that, for each item in the folder, the parent is properly set to the correct folder.

```
var myFolder = app.project.item(2);
if (!(myFolder instanceof FolderItem)) {
    alert("error: second item is not a folder");
} else {
    var numInFolder = myFolder.numItems;
    //Always run loops backwards when deleting things:
    for (var i = numInFolder; i >= 1; i--) {
        var curItem = myFolder.item(i);
        if (curItem.parentFolder !== myFolder) {
            alert("error within AE: the parentFolder is not set correctly");
        } else {
            if (!curItem.selected) {
                //found an unselected solid.
                curItem.remove();
            }
        }
    }
}

#### Description

Creates and returns a new [FolderItem object](#item-folderitem) and adds it to this collection.

If the ItemCollection belongs to the [project](#general-project-projectitems) or the [root folder](#general-project-projectrootfolder), then the new folder's `parentFolder` is the root folder.

If the ItemCollection belongs to any other folder, the new folder's `parentFolder` is that FolderItem. To put items in the folder, set the [Item.parentFolder](#item-item-itemparentfolder) attribute.

# AVItem object

`app.project.item(index)`

#### Description

The AVItem object provides access to attributes and methods of audio/visual files imported into After Effects.

Info

AVItem is a subclass of Item. All methods and attributes of Item, in addition to those listed below, are available when working with AVItem. See [Item object](#item-item)

Info

AVItem is the base class for both CompItem and FootageItem, so AVItem attributes and methods are also available when working with CompItem and FootageItem objects. See [CompItem object](#item-compitem) and [FootageItem object](#item-footageitem).

Warning

CompItems and FootageItems, while logical descendants of AVItem, are not *really* subclasses of AVItem as AVItem doesn't exist in Extendscript, ie. attempting to check if `item instanceof AVItem` will fail because AVItem is undefined. This is also true for `Item` itself.

See [Javascript Classes](#introduction-javascript-javascript-classes) and [After Effects Class Hierarchy](#introduction-classhierarchy) for more info.

---

## Attributes

### AVItem.duration

`app.project.item(index).duration`

#### Description

Returns the duration, in seconds, of the item. Still footage items have a duration of 0.

* In a CompItem, the value is linked to the duration of the composition, and is read/write.
* In a FootageItem, the value is linked to the `duration` of the `mainSource` object, and is read-only.

#### Type

Floating-point value, in the range `[0.0..10800.0]`; read/write for a [CompItem](#item-compitem); otherwise, read-only.

---

### AVItem.footageMissing

`app.project.item(index).footageMissing`

#### Description

When `true`, the AVItem is a placeholder, or represents footage with a source file that cannot be found. In this case, the path of the missing source file is in the `missingFootagePath` attribute of the footage item's source-file object. See [FootageItem.mainSource](#item-footageitem-footageitemmainsource) and [FileSource.missingFootagePath](#sources-filesource-filesourcemissingfootagepath).

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### AVItem.frameDuration

`app.project.item(index).frameDuration`

#### Description

Returns the length of a frame for this AVItem, in seconds. This is the reciprocal of `frameRate`. When set, the reciprocal is automatically set as a new `frameRate` value. This attribute returns the reciprocal of the `frameRate`, which may not be identical to a value you set, if that value is not evenly divisible into 1.0 (for example, 0.3). Due to numerical limitations, (1 / (1 / 0.3)) is close to, but not exactly, 0.3. If the AVItem is a FootageItem, this value is linked to the `mainSource`, and is read-only. To change it, set the `conformFrameRate` of the `mainSource` object. This sets both the `frameRate` and `frameDuration` of the FootageItem.

#### Type

Floating-point value, in the range `[1/99..1.0]`; read-only for a [FootageItem](#item-footageitem), otherwise read/write.

---

### AVItem.frameRate

`app.project.item(index).frameRate`

#### Description

The frame rate of the AVItem, in frames-per-second. This is the reciprocal of the `frameDuration` . When set, the reciprocal is automatically set as a new `frameDuration` value.

* In a CompItem, the value is linked to the `frameRate` of the composition, and is read/write.
* In a FootageItem, the value is linked to the `frameRate` of the `mainSource` object, and is read-only. To change it, set the `conformFrameRate` of the `mainSource` object. This sets both the `frameRate` and `frameDuration` of the FootageItem.

#### Type

Floating-point value, in the range `[1.0..99.0]`; read-only for a [FootageItem](#item-footageitem), otherwise read/write.

---

### AVItem.hasAudio

`app.project.item(index).hasAudio`

#### Description

When `true`, the AVItem has an audio component.

* In a CompItem, the value is linked to the composition.
* In a FootageItem, the value is linked to the `mainSource` object.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### AVItem.hasVideo

`app.project.item(index).hasVideo`

#### Description

## Methods

### AVItem.setProxy()

`app.project.item(index).setProxy(file)`

#### Description

Sets a file as the proxy of this AVItem.

Loads the specified file into a new FileSource object, sets this as the value of the `proxySource` attribute, and sets `useProxy` to `true`.

It does not preserve the interpretation parameters, instead using the user preferences. If the file has an unlabeled alpha channel, and the user preference says to ask the user what to do, the method estimates the alpha interpretation, rather than asking the user.

This differs from setting a FootageItem's `mainSource`, but both actions are performed as in the user interface.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | [Extendscript File](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/file-object.html) object | The file to be used as a proxy. |

#### Returns

None.

---

### AVItem.setProxyToNone()

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### AVItem.setProxyWithPlaceholder()

`app.project.item(index).setProxyWithPlaceholder(name, width, height ,frameRate, duration)`

#### Description

Creates a PlaceholderSource object with specified values, sets this as the value of the `proxySource` attribute, and sets `useProxy` to `true`. It does not preserve the interpretation parameters, instead using the user preferences.

Note

There is no direct way to set a placeholder as a proxy in the user interface; this behavior occurs when a proxy has been set and then moved or deleted.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | String | The name of the new object. |
| `width` | Integer, in the range `[4..30000]` | The pixel dimensions of the placeholder. |
| `height` | Integer, in the range `[4..30000]` | The pixel dimensions of the placeholder. |
| `frameRate` | Integer, in the range `[1..99]` | Frame rate for the proxy. |
| `duration` | Integer, in the range `[0.0..10800.0]` | The total length in seconds, up to 3 hours. |

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### AVItem.setProxyWithSequence()

`app.project.item(index).setProxyWithSequence(file,forceAlphabetical)`

#### Description

Sets a sequence of files as the proxy of this AVItem, with the option of forcing alphabetical order.
Loads the specified file sequence into a new FileSource object, sets this as the value of the `proxySource` attribute, and sets `useProxy` to `true`.

It does not preserve the interpretation parameters, instead using the user preferences.
If any file has an unlabeled alpha channel, and the user preference says to ask the user what to do, the method estimates the alpha interpretation, rather than asking the user.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | [Extendscript File](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/file-object.html) object | The first file in the sequence. |

#### Description

Creates a [SolidSource object](#sources-solidsource) with specified values, sets this as the value of the `proxySource` attribute, and sets `useProxy` to `true`. It does not preserve the interpretation parameters, instead using the user preferences.

Note

There is no way, using the user interface, to set a solid as a proxy; this feature is available only through scripting.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `color` | Array of three floating-point values, `[R, G, B]`, in the range `[0.0..1.0]`. | The color of the solid. |

The attribute is read-only. To change its value, call one of the FootageItem "replace" methods. See the [FootageSource object](#sources-footagesource), and its three types:

* [SolidSource object](#sources-solidsource)
* [FileSource object](#sources-filesource)
* [PlaceholderSource object](#sources-placeholdersource)

If this is a FileSource object, and the [footageMissing](#item-avitem-avitemfootagemissing) value is `true`, the path to the missing footage file is in the [FileSource.missingFootagePath](#sources-filesource-filesourcemissingfootagepath) attribute.

#### Type

[FootageSource object](#sources-footagesource); read-only.

## Methods

### FootageItem.openInViewer()

`app.project.item(index).openInViewer()`

#### Description

Opens the footage in a Footage panel, and moves the Footage panel to front and gives it focus.

Tip

Missing and placeholder footage can be opened using this method, but cannot manually (via double-clicking it).

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

[Viewer object](#other-viewer) for the Footage panel, or `null` if the footage could not be opened.

---

### FootageItem.replace()

`app.project.item(index).replace(file)`

# Layer

# Layer object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index)`

#### Description

The Layer object provides access to layers within compositions. It can be accessed from an item's layer collection either by index number or by a name string.

Info

Layer is a subclass of [PropertyGroup](#property-propertygroup), which is a subclass of [PropertyBase](#property-propertybase). All methods and attributes of PropertyGroup, in addition to those listed below, are available when working with Layer, with the exception that `propertyIndex` attribute is set to `undefined`.

Info

Layer is the base class for [CameraLayer object](#layer-cameralayer), [LightLayer object](#layer-lightlayer), and [AVLayer object](#layer-avlayer), so Layer attributes and methods are available when working with all layer types. Layers contain AE properties, in addition to their JavaScript attributes and methods. For examples of how to access properties in layers, see [PropertyBase object](#property-propertybase).

#### Example

If the first item in the project is a [CompItem](#item-compitem), this example disables the first layer in that composition and renames it. This might, for example, turn an icon off in the composition.

```
var firstLayer = app.project.item(1).layer(1);
firstLayer.enabled = false;
firstLayer.name = "DisabledLayer";

```

Predefined animation preset files are installed in the Presets folder, and users can create new animation presets through the user interface.

Warning

The animation preset is applied to the the selected layer(s) of the comp, not to the layer whose applyPreset function is called. Hence, the layer whose applyPreset function is called effectively just determines the comp whose layers are processed.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

Creates a new Layer object with the same values as this one, and prepends the new object to the [LayerCollection object](#layer-layercollection) in the target CompItem. Retrieve the copy using into `Comp.layer(1)`.

Copying in a layer changes the index positions of previously existing layers in the target composition.

This is the same as copying and pasting a layer through the user interface.

Note

As of After Effects 13.6, this method no longer causes After Effects to crash when the layer has a parent.

Warning

As of After Effects 13.7 (13.6, has not been tested), if the copied layer has an effect on it and the user undoes the action, After Effects will Crash.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intoComp` | [CompItem object](#item-compitem) | The target composition. |

#### Returns

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `layerIndices` | Array of integers | The position indexes of the layers to be collected. |
| `name` | String | The name of the new [CompItem](#item-compitem) object. |
| `moveAllAttributes` | Boolean | Optional. When `true` (the default), retains all attributes in the new composition. This is the same as selecting the "Move all attributes into the new composition" option in the Pre-compose dialog box. You can only set this to `false` if there is just one index in the `layerIndices` array. This is the same as selecting the "Leave all attributes in" option in the Pre-compose dialog box. |

#### Returns

[CompItem object](#item-compitem).

# AVLayer object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index)`

#### Description

The AVLayer object provides an interface to those layers that contain AVItem objects (composition layers, footage layers, solid layers, text layers, and sound layers).

Info

AVLayer is a subclass of [Layer object](#layer-layer). All methods and attributes of Layer, in addition to those listed below, are available when working with AVLayer.

Info

AVLayer is a base class for [TextLayer object](#layer-textlayer), so AVLayer attributes and methods are available when working with TextLayer objects.

#### AE Properties

#### Example

If the first item in the project is a CompItem, and the first layer of that CompItem is an AVLayer, the following sets the layer `quality`, `startTime`, and `inPoint`.

```
var firstLayer = app.project.item(1).layer(1);
firstLayer.quality = LayerQuality.BEST;
firstLayer.startTime = 1;
firstLayer.inPoint = 2;

# ThreeDModelLayer object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index)`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.4

#### Description

The ThreeDModelLayer object represents a 3D Model layer within a composition.

Info

ThreeDModelLayer is a subclass of [AVLayer object](#layer-avlayer). All methods and attributes of AVLayer are available when working with ThreeDModelLayer.

#### AE Properties

ThreeDModelLayer inherits the following properties and property groups from [AVLayer object](#layer-avlayer):

* Marker
* Time Remap
* Transform
	+ Anchor Point
	+ Position
	+ Scale
	+ Orientation
	+ X Rotation
	+ Y Rotation
	+ Rotation
	+ Opacity
* Layer Styles
* Audio
	+ AudioLevels

#### Example

If the first item in the project is a CompItem, and the first layer of that CompItem is an ThreeDModelLayer, the following checks its type.

```
var modelLayer = app.project.item(1).layer(1);
if (modelLayer instanceof ThreeDModelLayer)
{
    // do something
}

```

# Property

# Property object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec`

#### Description

The Property object contains value, keyframe, and expression information about a particular AE property of a layer. An AE property is a value, often animatable, of an effect, mask, or transform within an individual layer. For examples of how to access properties, see [PropertyBase object](#property-propertybase) and [PropertyGroup.property()](#property-propertygroup-propertygroupproperty).

Info

Property is a subclass of [PropertyBase](#property-propertybase). All methods and attributes of PropertyBase, in addition to those listed below, are available when working with Property.

Note

JavaScript objects commonly referred to as "properties" are called "attributes" in this guide, to avoid confusion with the After Effects definition of property.

#### Examples

Get and set the value of opacity:

```
var myProperty = myLayer.opacity;
// opacity has propertyValueType of OneD, and is stored as a float
myProperty.setValue(50); //set opacity to 50%
// Variable my Opacity is a float value
var myOpacity = myProperty.value;

```

Get and set the value of a position:

```
var myProperty = myLayer.position;
// position has propertyValueType of ThreeD_SPATIAL, and is stored as an array of 3 floats
myProperty.setValue([10.0, 30.0, 0.0]);
// Variable my Position is an array of 3 floats
var myPosition = myProperty.value;

```

Change the value of a mask shape to be open instead of closed:

```
var myMask = mylayer.mask(1);
var myProperty = myMask.maskPath;
myShape = myProperty.value;
myShape.closed = false;
myProperty.setValue(myShape);

```

Get the value of a color at a particular time. A color is stored as an array of four floats, `[r, g, b, opacity]`. This sets the value of the red component of a light's color at time 4 to be half of that at time 2:

```
var myProperty = myLight.color;
var colorValue = myProperty.valueAtTime(2, true);
colorValue[0] = 0.5 * colorValue[0];
myProperty.setValueAtTime(4, colorValue);

```

Check that a scale calculated by an expression at time 3.5 is the expected value of [10,50]:

```
var myProperty = myLayer.scale;
// false value of preExpression means evaluate the expression
var scaleValue = myProperty.valueAtTime(3.5, false);

if (scaleValue[0] === 10 && scaleValue[1] === 50) {
    alert("hurray");
} else {
    alert("oops");
}

```

Keyframe a rotation from 0 to 90 and back again. The animation is 10 seconds, and the middle keyframe is at the 5 second mark. Rotation properties are stored as a OneD value:

```
var myProperty = myLayer.rotation;
myProperty.setValueAtTime(0, 0);
myProperty.setValueAtTime(5, 90);
myProperty.setValueAtTime(10, 0);

```

Change the key frame values for the first three keyframes of some sourcetext:

```
var myProperty = myTextLayer.sourceText;
if (myProperty.numKeys < 3) {
    alert("error, I thought there were 3 keyframes");
} else {
    myProperty.setValueAtKey(1, newTextDocument("keynumber1"));
    myProperty.setValueAtKey(2, newTextDocument("keynumber2"));
    myProperty.setValueAtKey(3, newTextDocument("keynumber3"));
}

```

Set values using the convenience syntax for position, scale, color, or source text:

```
// These two are equivalent. The second fills in a default of 0.
myLayer.position.setValue([20, 30, 0]);
myLayer.position.setValue([20, 30]);
// These two are equivalent. The second fills in a defaultof 100.
myLayer.scale.setValue([50, 50, 100]);
myLayer.scale.setValue([50, 50]);
// These two are equivalent. The second fills in a defaultof 1.0
myLight.color.setValue([0.8, 0.3, 0.1, 1.0]);
myLight.color.setValue([0.8, 0.3, 0.1]);
// These two are equivalent. The second creates a TextDocument
myTextLayer.sourceText.setValue(newTextDocument("foo"));
myTextLayer.sourceText.setValue("foo");

```

## Attributes

### Property.alternateSource

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.alternateSource`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 18.0 (2021)

#### Description

The value is `null` when:

* The alternate source is not set for the associated layer.
* The property cannot be used to set an alternate source.

Use [Property.canSetAlternateSource](#property-property-propertycansetalternatesource) to determine if the property is a Media Replacement Essential Property.

All Media Replacement Layers have an alternate source item that can be set.

A layer is "marked" for media replacement when the layer is added to the Essential Graphics Panel (see [AVLayer.addToMotionGraphicsTemplate()](#layer-avlayer-avlayeraddtomotiongraphicstemplate) or [AVLayer.addToMotionGraphicsTemplateAs()](#layer-avlayer-avlayeraddtomotiongraphicstemplateas)).

* If present, the render workflow will pick up the alternate source while rendering the layer.
* If the alternate source for the layer is not set, then the source layer of the Media Replacement control is used for rendering (this is the normal workflow).

Use [Property.setAlternateSource()](#property-property-propertysetalternatesource) to change the value.

#### Type

AVItem object; read-only.

### Property.propertyParameters

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.propertyParameters`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects (Beta) 26.0 and is subject to change while it remains in Beta.

#### Description

An array of all item strings in a dropdown menu property. This attribute applies to dropdown menu properties of effects and layers, including custom strings in the Menu property of the Dropdown Menu Control.

This property corresponds to [Property.setPropertyParameters()](#property-property-propertysetpropertyparameters), acting as the getter for the strings in a dropdown menu.

#### Examples

### Property.propertyValueType

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.propertyValueType`

#### Description

The type of value stored in the named property. The `PropertyValueType` enumeration has one value for each type of data that can be stored in or retrieved from a property. Each type of data is stored and retrieved in a different kind of structure. All property objects store data according to one of these categories. For example, a 3D spatial property (such as a layer's position) is stored as an array of three floating-point values. When setting a value for position, pass in such an array, as follows: `mylayer.property("position").setValue([10, 20, 0]);`

In contrast, a shape property (such as a layer's mask shape) is stored as a Shape object. When setting a value for a shape, pass a Shape object, as follows:

```
var myShape = new Shape();
myShape.vertices = [[0,0], [0,100], [100,100], [100,0]];
var myMask = mylayer.property("ADBE Mask Parade").property(1);
myMask.property("ADBE Mask Shape").setValue(myShape);

```

#### Type

A `PropertyValueType` enumerated value; read/write. One of:

* `PropertyValueType.NO_VALUE`: Stores no data.
* `PropertyValueType.ThreeD_SPATIAL`: Array of three floating-point positional values. For example, an Anchor Point value might be [10.0, 20.2, 0.0]
* `PropertyValueType.ThreeD`: Array of three floating-point quantitative values. For example, a Scale value might be [100.0, 20.2, 0.0]
* `PropertyValueType.TwoD_SPATIAL`: Array of 2 floating-point positional values. For example, an Anchor Point value might be [5.1, 10.0]
* `PropertyValueType.TwoD`: Array of 2 floating-point quantitative values. For example, a Scale value might be [5.1, 100.0]
* `PropertyValueType.OneD`: A floating-point value.
* `PropertyValueType.COLOR`:Array of 4 floating-point values in the range `[0.0..1.0]`. For example, [0.8, 0.3, 0.1, 1.0]
* `PropertyValueType.CUSTOM_VALUE` : Custom property value, such as the Histogram property for the Levels effect.
* `PropertyValueType.MARKER`: [MarkerValue object](#other-markervalue)

---

### Property.separationLeader

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.separationLeader`

#### Description

The original multidimensional property for this separated follower. For example, if the current property is Y Position, this attribute's value points to the Position property.

Tip

The original, consolidated, multidimensional property is the "separation leader" and the new, separated, single-dimensional properties are its "separation followers".

#### Type

Property object; read-only.

---

### Property.unitsText

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.unitsText`

#### Description

### Property.setPropertyParameters()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.setPropertyParameters(items)`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 17.0.1 (2020)

#### Description

Sets parameters for a Dropdown Menu Control's Menu Property. This method will overwrite the existing set of Menu items with the provided array of strings.

* The Dropdown Menu Control effect's Menu property is the only property that allows parameters to be set.
* To check if a property allows parameters to be set, check with [isDropdownEffect](#property-property-propertyisdropdowneffect) before calling this method.
* An exception is raised whenever this method fails.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `items` | Array of strings | Values which will replace the existing menu entries in a Dropdown Menu Control.  - Only strings are allowed. - Empty item strings are not allowed. - Duplicate item strings are not allowed. - The character `"\"` is not allowed in the item strings. - The string `"(-"` can be specified as of the item strings, to create a separator line in the dropdown menu. The separator lines will claim an index for each of themselves. |

Tip

Item strings should be in ASCII or MultiByte encodable in the current code-page. In other words, the item strings should be provided in the script of the running system.

For example: Specifying the item strings in Japanese while running the script on an English system will create a dropdown effect with illegible characters in the item strings.

#### Example

```
var dropdownItems = [
    "First Item",
    "Second Item",
    "(-",
    "Another Item",
    "Last Item"
];

var dropdownEffect = layer.property("ADBE Effect Parade").addProperty("ADBE Dropdown Control");
dropdownEffect.property(1).setPropertyParameters(dropdownItems);

```

#### Returns

Property object, the updated Dropdown Menu Control's Menu property.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `keyIndex` | Integer, in the range `[1..numKeys]` | The index for the keyframe, as returned by the [addKey](#property-property-propertyaddkey) or [nearestKeyIndex](#property-property-propertynearestkeyindex). |

---

### Property.valueAtTime()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.valueAtTime(time, preExpression)`

#### Description

The value of the named property as evaluated at the specified time. Note that the type of value returned is not made explicit; it will be of a different type, depending on the property evaluated.

Tip

As After Effects 13.6, this method now waits for time-intensive expressions, like `sampleImage`, to finish evaluating before it returns the result.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `time` | Floating-point value | The time, in seconds, at which to set the value. The beginning of the composition is 0. |
| `preExpression` | Boolean | If the property has an expression and this is `true`, return the value for the specified time without applying the expression to it. When `false`, return the result of evaluating the expression for the specified time. Ignored if the property does not have an associated expression. |

#### Returns

A value appropriate for the type of the property (see "Property propertyValueType attribute" on page 138).

# PropertyBase object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec`

#### Description

Properties are accessed by name through layers, using various kinds of expression syntax, as controlled by application preferences. For example, the following are all ways of access properties in the Effects group

```
var effect1 = app.project.item(1).layer(1).effect("AddGrain")("Viewing Mode");
var effect1again = app.project.item(1).layer(1).effect.addGrain.viewingMode;
var effect1againtoo = app.project.item(1).layer(1)("Effects").addGrain.viewingMode;
var effect1againtoo2 = app.project.item(1).layer(1)("Effects")("Add Grain")("Viewing Mode");

```

See also [PropertyGroup.property()](#property-propertygroup-propertygroupproperty).

Info

PropertyBase is the base class for both [Property](#property-property) and [PropertyGroup](#property-propertygroup), so PropertyBase attributes and methods are available when working with properties and property groups.

#### Reference invalidation

When something occurs that changes an object sufficiently for the reference to become invalid, script references to that object can generate errors. In simple cases this is straightforward. For example, if you delete anobject, a reference to the deleted object generates the warning "Object is Invalid":

```
var layer1 = app.project.item(1).layer(1);
layer1.remove();
alert(layer1.name); // invalid reference to deleted object

```

Similarly, if you reference an AE property in a deleted object, the warning occurs

```
var layer1 = app.project.item(1).layer(1);
var layer1position = layer1.transform.position;
layer1.remove();
alert(layer1position.value); // invalid reference to property inselected object

```

A less straightforward case is when a property is removed from a property group. In this case, After Effectsgenerates the "Object is Invalid" error when you subsequently reference that item or other items in the group,because their index positions have changed. For example:

```
var effect1 = app.project.item(1).layer(1).effect(1);
var effect2 = app.project.item(1).layer(1).effect(2);
var effect2param = app.project.item(1).layer(1).effect(2).blendWithOriginal;
effect1.remove();
alert(effect2.name); // invalid reference because group index positions have changed

```

## Attributes

### PropertyBase.active

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).active`

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.active`

#### Description

For a layer, this corresponds to the setting of the eyeball icon. When `true`, the layer's video is active at the current time. For this to be `true`, the layer must be enabled, no other layer may be soloing unless this layer is soloed too, and the time must be between the `inPoint` and `outPoint` values of this layer.

This value is never `true` in an audio layer; there is a separate `audioActive` attribute in the AVLayer object [AVLayer.audioActive](#layer-avlayer-avlayeraudioactive).

For an effect and all properties, it is the same as the enabled attribute, except that it's read-only.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.canSetEnabled

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.canSetEnabled`

#### Description

When `true`, you can set the `enabled` attribute value. Generally, this is `true` if the user interface displays an eyeball icon for this property; it is `true` for all layers.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.elided

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.elided`

#### Description

When `true`, this property is a group used to organize other properties. The property is not displayed in the user interface and its child properties are not indented in the Timeline panel.For example, for a text layer with two animators and no properties twirled down, you might see:

* `Text`
* `PathOptions`
* `MoreOptions`
* `Animator1`
* `Animator2`

In this example, "Animator 1" and "Animator 2" are contained in a PropertyBase called "Text Animators." This parent group is not displayed in the user interface, and so the two child properties are not indented in the Timeline panel.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.enabled

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).enabled`

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.enabled`

#### Description

For layer, this corresponds to the video switch state of the layer in the Timeline panel. For an effect and all properties, it corresponds to the setting of the eyeball icon, if there is one.

When `true`, the layer or property is enabled; otherwise `false`.

#### Type

Boolean; read/write if `canSetEnabled` is `true`, read-only if `canSetEnabled` is `false`.

### PropertyBase.isEffect

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.isEffect`

#### Description

When `true`, this property is an effect PropertyGroup.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.isMask

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.isMask`

#### Description

When `true`, this property is a mask PropertyGroup.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.isModified

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.matchName

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.matchName`

#### Description

A special name for the property used to build unique naming paths. The match name is not displayed, but you can refer to it in scripts. Every property has a unique match-name identifier. Match names are stable from version to version regardless of the display name (the name attribute value) or any changes to the application. Unlike the display name, it is not localized. An indexed group may not have a name value, but always has a matchName value. (An indexed group has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#property-propertybase-propertybasepropertytype).)

#### Type

String; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.name

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).name`

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.name`

#### Description

For a layer, the name of the layer. By default, this is the same as the Source name, unless [Layer.isNameSet](#layer-layer-layerisnameset) returns `false`.

For an effect and all properties - the display name of the property. (Compare [PropertyBase.matchName](#property-propertybase-propertybasematchname).) It is an error to set the name value if the property is not a child of an indexed group (that is, a property group that has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#property-propertybase-propertybasepropertytype)).

#### Type

String; read/write for a child of an indexed group; otherwise read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.parentProperty

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.parentProperty`

#### Description

The property group that is the immediate parent of this property, or `null` if this PropertyBase is a layer.

#### Type

PropertyGroup object or `null`; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.propertyDepth

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.propertyDepth`

#### Description

The number of levels of parent groups between this property and the containing layer. The value 0 for a layer.

#### Type

Integer; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.propertyIndex

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.propertyIndex`

#### Description

The position index of this property within its parent group, if it is a child of an indexed group (a property group that has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#property-propertybase-propertybasepropertytype)).

#### Type

Integer; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.propertyType

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.propertyType`

#### Description

The type of this property.

#### Type

A `PropertyType` enumerated value; read/write. One of:

* `PropertyType.PROPERTY`: A single property such as position or zoom.
* `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`: A property group whose members have an editable name and an index. Effects and masks are indexed groups. For example, the masks property of a layer refers to a variable number of individual masks by index number.
* `PropertyType.NAMED_GROUP`: A property group in which the member names are not editable. Layers are named groups.

---

### PropertyBase.selected

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.selected`

#### Description

When `true`, this property is selected. Set to `true` to select the property, or to `false` to deselect it. Sampling this attribute repeatedly for a large number of properties can slow down system performance. To read the full set of selected properties of a composition or layer, use either [CompItem.selectedProperties](#item-compitem-compitemselectedproperties) or [Layer.selectedProperties](#layer-layer-layerselectedproperties).

#### Type

Boolean; read/write.

## Methods

### PropertyBase.duplicate()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.duplicate()`

#### Description

If this property is a child of an indexed group, creates and returns a new PropertyBase object with the same attribute values as this one. If this property is not a child of an indexed group, the method generates an exception and displays an error. An indexed group has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#property-propertybase-propertybasepropertytype).

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

PropertyBase object.

---

### PropertyBase.moveTo()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.moveTo(newIndex)`

#### Description

Moves this property to a new position in its parent property group. This method is valid only for children of indexed groups; if it is not, or if the index value is not valid, the method generates an exception and displays an error. (An indexed group has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#property-propertybase-propertybasepropertytype).)

Warning

Using this method invalidates existing references to other children in the same indexed group. For example, if you have three effects on a layer, each effect assigned to a different variable, moving one of the effects invalidates the references for all of these variables. You will need to reassign them.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `newIndex` | Integer | The new index position at which to place this property in its group. |

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### PropertyBase.propertyGroup()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.propertyGroup([countUp])`

#### Description

Gets the PropertyGroup object for an ancestor group of this property at a specified level of the parent-child hierarchy.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `countUp` | Integer, in the range `[1..propertyDepth]` | Optional. The number of levels to ascend within the parent-child hierarchy. Default is 1, which gets the immediate parent. |

#### Returns

PropertyGroup object, or [Layer object](#layer-layer) if the count reaches the containing layer.

#### Example

```
var containing_layer = my_property.propertyGroup(my_property.propertyDepth);

```

---

### PropertyBase.remove()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.remove()`

#### Description

Removes this property from its parent group. If this is a property group, it removes the child properties as well. This method is valid only for children of indexed groups; if it is not, or if the index value is not valid, the method generates an exception and displays an error. (An indexed group has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#property-propertybase-propertybasepropertytype).) This method can be called on a text animation property (that is, any animator that has been set to a text layer).

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Nothing.

# PropertyGroup object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec`

#### Description

The PropertyGroup object represents a group of properties. It can contain Property objects and other PropertyGroup objects. Property groups can be nested to provide a parent-child hierarchy, with a Layer object at the top (root) down to a single Property object, such as the mask feather of the third mask. To traverse the group hierarchy, use PropertyBase methods and attributes; see [PropertyBase.propertyGroup()](#property-propertybase-propertybasepropertygroup). For examples of how to access properties and property groups, see [PropertyBase object](#property-propertybase).

Info

PropertyGroup is a subclass of [PropertyBase](#property-propertybase). All methods and attributes of PropertyBase, in addition to those listed below, are available when working with PropertyGroup.

Info

PropertyGroup is a base class for [Layer](#layer-layer) and [MaskPropertyGroup](#property-maskpropertygroup). PropertyGroup attributes and methods are available when working with layer or mask groups.

---

## Attributes

### PropertyGroup.numProperties

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec.numProperties`

#### Description

The number of indexed properties in this group.

For layers, this method returns a value of 3, corresponding to the mask, effect, and motion tracker groups, which are the indexed groups within the layer.

However, layers also have many other properties available only by name; see [PropertyGroup.property()](#property-propertygroup-propertygroupproperty).

#### Type

Integer; read-only.

---

## Methods

### PropertyGroup.addProperty()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec.addProperty(name)`

#### Description

Creates and returns a PropertyBase object with the specified name, and adds it to this group.

In general, you can only add properties to an indexed group (a property group that has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#property-propertybase-propertybasepropertytype)).
The only exception is a text animator property, which can be added to a named group (a property group that has the type `PropertyType.NAMED_GROUP`).

If this method cannot create a property with the specified name, it generates an exception.

To check that you can add a particular property to this group, call `canAddProperty` before calling this method. (See [PropertyGroup.canAddProperty()](#property-propertygroup-propertygroupcanaddproperty).)

Warning

When you add a new property to an indexed group, the indexed group gets recreated from scratch, invalidating all existing references to properties.

One workaround is to store the index of the added property with property.propertyIndex.

#### Examples

This won't work, as the slider object becomes invalid once we add the Color Control property:

```
var effectsProperty = layer.property("ADBE Effect Parade");
var slider = effectsProperty.addProperty("ADBE Slider Control");
var color = effectsProperty.addProperty("ADBE Color Control");

var sliderProperty = slider.property("ADBE Slider Control-0001"); // Object 'slider' is Invalid

```

This revised method will work:

```
var effectsProperty = layer.property("ADBE Effect Parade");
var slider = effectsProperty.addProperty("ADBE Slider Control");
var sliderIndex = slider.propertyIndex; // Store 'slider' effect index so it can be reused later
var color = effectsProperty.addProperty("ADBE Color Control");

var sliderProperty = effectsProperty.property(sliderIndex).property("ADBE Slider Control-0001");

```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | String | The display name or [matchName](#property-propertybase-propertybasematchname) of the property to add. The following names are supported:  - Any match name for a property that can be added through the user interface. For example, `"ADBE Mask Atom`", `"ADBE Paint Atom`", `"ADBE Text Position`", `"ADBE Text Anchor Point`". - When adding to an ADBE Mask Parade: `"ADBE Mask Atom`", `"Mask`". - When adding to an ADBE Effect Parade, any effect by match name, such as `"ADBE Bulge`", `"ADBE Glo2`", `"APC Vegas`". - Any effect by display name, such as `"Bulge`", `"Glow`", `"Vegas`". - For text animators, `"ADBE Text Animator`". - For selectors, Range Selector has the name `"ADBE Text Selector`", Wiggly Selector has the name `"ADBE Text Wiggly Selector`", and Expression Selector has the name `"ADBE Text Expressible Selector`". |

#### Returns

[PropertyBase object](#property-propertybase).

---

### PropertyGroup.canAddProperty()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec.canAddProperty(name)`

#### Description

Returns `true` if a property with the given name can be added to this property group.

For example, you can only add mask to a mask group. The only legal input arguments are "mask" or "ADBE Mask Atom".

```
maskGroup.canAddProperty("mask"); // returns `true`
maskGroup.canAddProperty("ADBE Mask Atom"); // returns `true`
maskGroup.canAddProperty("blend"); // returns false

```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | String | The display name or match name of the property to be checked. (See [PropertyGroup.addProperty()](#property-propertygroup-propertygroupaddproperty)). |

#### Returns

Boolean.

---

### PropertyGroup.addVariableFontAxis()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec.addVariableFontAxis(axisTag)`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects (Beta) 26.0 and is subject to change while it remains in Beta.

#### Description

Creates and returns a Property object for a variable font axis, and adds it to this property group. This method can only be called on the "ADBE Text Animator Properties" property group within a text animator.

Common axis tags include (but are not limited to):

* `"wght"` - Weight (100-900 typical range)
* `"wdth"` - Width (percentage of normal width)
* `"slnt"` - Slant (angle in degrees)
* `"ital"` - Italic (0-1 range)
* `"opsz"` - Optical Size (point size)

Fonts may also include custom axes with 4-character uppercase tags (e.g., `"INFM"` for Informality).

#### Variable Font Spacing

When animating Variable Font axes, individual characters can change width. The Variable Font Spacing property (found in the "More Options" section of a text animator) controls how After Effects handles character spacing compensation for these width changes.

The Variable Font Spacing property can be accessed via its matchName `"ADBE Text Variable Font Spacing"` and is a dropdown control property. This property appears only when at least one variable font axis is active in the animator.

Tip

Axes must exist on the font to have any impact. To discover what axes a font supports, use [FontObject.designAxesData](#text-fontobject-fontobjectdesignaxesdata).

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `axisTag` | String | The 4-character tag identifying the variable font axis (e.g., `"wght"`, `"wdth"`, `"slnt"`, `"ital"`). |

#### Returns

[Property object](#property-property) representing the variable font axis.

#### Examples

```
// Create a comp
var comp = app.project.items.addComp("Create Axis Comp", 1920, 1080, 1, 30, 30);
comp.openInViewer();

// Create a text layer
var textLayer = comp.layers.addText("Hello World!");

// Set the font to variable font
var textDocument = textLayer.property("Source Text").value;
textDocument.font = 'ShantellSans'; // Must be a variable font
textLayer.property("Source Text").setValue(textDocument);

// Get the text property and animators group
var textProp = textLayer.property("Text");
var animators = textProp.property("Animators");

// Add a new animator
var animator = animators.addProperty("ADBE Text Animator");
var animatorProps = animator.property("ADBE Text Animator Properties");

// Add the Weight axis
var axisProp = animatorProps.addVariableFontAxis("wght");

// Set a static value
axisProp.setValue(700);

// Set keyframes
axisProp.setValueAtTime(0, 300);  // Light at 0 seconds
axisProp.setValueAtTime(2, 900);  // Heavy at 2 seconds

```

---

### PropertyGroup.property()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec.property(index)`

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec.property(name)`

#### Description

Finds and returns a child property of this group, as specified by either its index or name. A name specification can use the same syntax that is available with expressions. The following are all allowed and are equivalent:

```
mylayer.position;
mylayer("position");
mylayer.property("position");
mylayer(1);
mylayer.property(1);

```

Some properties of a layer, such as position and zoom, can be accessed only by name. When using the name to find a property that is multiple levels down, you must make more than one call to this method.

For example, the following call searches two levels down, and returns the first mask in the mask group: `myLayer.property("ADBE Masks").property(1)`

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index` | Integer | The index for the child property, in the range `[1..numProperties]`, if this is an indexed group. |
| `name` | String | The name of the child property. This can be:  - Any match name - Any name in expression "parenthesis style" syntax, meaning the display name or the compact English name - Any name in expression "intercap style" syntax.  For supported property names, see the table below. |

#### Returns

[PropertyBase object](#property-propertybase) or `null` if no child property with the specified string name is found.

#### Properties accessible by name

#### Examples

If a layer named "myLayer" has a Box Blur effect, you can retrieve the effect in any of the following ways:

```
myLayer.property("Effects").property("Box Blur");
myLayer.property("Effects").property("boxBlur");
myLayer.property("Effects").property("ADBE Box Blur");

```

If a layer named "myLayer" has a mask named "Mask 1" you can retrieve it as follows:

```

Warning

There is a bug that causes OutputModule object to be invalidated after the output module setting is modified, so you need to retrieve the Output Module again after you modify it.

#### Examples

Get the settings from one item's output module and use them on another:

```
// If you want to get the values in the number format, use
// GetSettingsFormat.NUMBER_SETTABLE as an argument.

var omItem1_settable_str = app.project.renderQueue.item(1).outputModule(1).getSettings( GetSettingsFormat.STRING_SETTABLE );

// Set output module item 1 of render queue item 2 with values that you get from
// output module 1 of render queue item 1

app.project.renderQueue.item(2).outputModule(1).setSettings( omItem1_settable_str );

```

Set output module item 1 of render queue item 3 with values that you create:

```
var crop_data = {
    "Crop":        true,
    "Crop Bottom": 0,
    "Crop Left":   0,
    "Crop Right":  8,
    "Crop Top":    10
};

app.project.renderQueue.item(1).outputModule(3).setSettings( crop_data );

```

Route the output file to the user directory:

```
var om1 = app.project.renderQueue.item(1).outputModule(1);
var file_name = File.decode( om1.file.name ); // Name contains special character, space?
var new_dir = new Folder( "~/new_output" );
var new_path = new_dir.fsName;

var new_data = {
    "Output File Info": {
        "Base Path":      new_path,
        "Subfolder Path": "draft",
        "File Name":      file_name
    }
};

om1.setSettings( new_data );

```

In this example, the output file is routed to the user directory, but this time using the full path:

```
var om1 = app.project.renderQueue.item(1).outputModule(1);

// Name contains special character, such as space?
var file_name = File.decode( om1.file.name );
var new_path = "/Users/myAccount/new_output";
var separator = "/";

if ($.os.indexOf("Mac") == -1) {
    new_path = "C:\Users\myAccount\new_output";
    separator = "\\";
}

var new_data = {
    "Output File Info": {
        "Full Flat Path": new_path + separator + file_name
    }
};

om1.setSettings( new_data );

```

---

## Attributes

### SolidSource.color

`solidSource.color`

#### Description

The color of the solid, expressed as red, green, and blue values.

#### Type

Array of three floating-point values, `[R, G, B]`, in the range `[0.0..1.0]`; read/write.

# Text

# CharacterRange object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).text.sourceText.value.characterRange(characterIndexStart, [signedCharacterIndexEnd])`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.3

#### Description

The CharacterRange object is an accessor to a character range of the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) instance it was created from.

Unlike the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument), which looks at only the first character when returning character attributes, here the character range can span zero or more characters. As a consequence, two or more characters *may not have the same attribute value* and this mixed state will be signaled by returning `undefined`.

* The [characterStart](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterstart) attribute is the first character index of the range.
* The [characterEnd](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterend) attribue will report the (last + 1) character index of the range, such that ([characterEnd](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterend) - [characterStart](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterstart)) represents the number of characters in the range.

It is acceptable for most attributes for the effective range to be zero - otherwise known as an insertion point.

When accessed, the CharacterRange object will check that [characterStart](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterend) of the range remains valid for the current span of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument). This is the same rule as applied when the CharacterRange was created, but because the length of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) can change through the addition or removal of characters, the [characterStart](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#text-characterrange-characterrangecharacterend) may no longer be valid. In this situation an exception will be thrown on access, either read or write. The [isRangeValid](#text-characterrange-characterrangeisrangevalid) attribute will return `false` if the effective range is no longer valid.

Note that if the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) length changes, the [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange-characterrange-object) range could become valid again.

#### Differences from TextDocument

Because CharacterRange is an accessor of [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument), most methods and attributes of TextDocument are available when working with CharacterRange. The attributes and methods that are unique to CharacterRange or exhibit unique behaviors are included on this page.

The following attributes and methods are **not** available on instances of CharacterRange:

| Attributes | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| `baselineLocs` | `characterRange` |
| `boxText` | `paragraphCharacterIndexesAt` |
| `boxTextPos` | `paragraphRange` |
| `boxTextSize` |  |
| `lineOrientation` |  |
| `paragraphCount` |  |
| `pointText` |  |

#### Examples

This increases the font size of the first character in the TextDocument, and set the rest of the characters to fontSize 40.

```
var textDocument = app.project.item(index).layer(index).property("Source Text").value;
var characterRange = textDocument.characterRange(0,1);

characterRange.fontSize = characterRange.fontSize + 5;
textDocument.characterRange(1,-1).fontSize = 40;

```

---

## Attributes

### CharacterRange.characterEnd

`CharacterRange.characterEnd`

#### Description

The Text layer range calculated character end value.

Throws an exception on access if the effective value would exceed the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument).

#### Type

Unsigned integer; read-only.

---

### CharacterRange.characterStart

`CharacterRange.characterStart`

#### Description

The Text layer range calculated character start value.

Throws an exception on access if the effective value would exceed the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument).

#### Type

Unsigned integer; read-only.

---

### CharacterRange.fillColor

`CharacterRange.fillColor`

#### Description

The Text layer range CharacterRange attribute Fill Color, as an array of `[r, g, b]` floating-point values.

For example, in an 8-bpc project, a red value of 255 would be 1.0, and in a 32-bpc project, an overbright blue value can be something like 3.2.

Setting this value will also set `applyFill` to `true` across the affected characters.

If this attribute has a mixed value for the range of characters, it will be read as `undefined`.

Warning

In contrast to the same attribute on the TextDocument API, we will *not* throw an exception on read if `applyFill` is not `true`.

#### Type

Array `[r, g, b]` of floating-point values; read/write.

---

### CharacterRange.isRangeValid

`CharacterRange.isRangeValid`

#### Description

Returns `true` if the current range is within the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument), otherwise `false`.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### CharacterRange.kerning

`CharacterRange.kerning`

#### Description

The Text layer range character attribute kerning option.

This effectively reports the manual kerning value, and not the calculated kerning value from auto kerning.

* If [autoKernType](#text-textdocument-textdocumentautokerntype) in the range is set to `AutoKernType.METRIC_KERN`, `AutoKernType.OPTICAL_KERN`, or is mixed, then this attribute will be returned as `undefined`.
* If [autoKernType](#text-textdocument-textdocumentautokerntype) in the range is set to `AutoKernType.NO_AUTO_KERN`, and this attribute has a mixed value, it will be read as `undefined`.

Setting this value will also set `AutoKernType.NO_AUTO_KERN` to `true` across the affected characters.

#### Type

Integer value; read/write.

---

### CharacterRange.strokeColor

`CharacterRange.strokeColor`

#### Description

The Text layer CharacterRange stroke color character property, as an array of [r, g, b] floating-point values.

For example, in an 8-bpc project, a red value of 255 would be 1.0, and in a 32-bpc project, an overbright blue value can be something like 3.2.

If this attribute has a mixed value, it will be read as `undefined`.

Setting this value will also set [applyStroke](#text-textdocument-textdocumentapplystroke) to `true` across the affected characters.

Warning

In contrast to the same attribute on the TextDocument API, we will *not* throw an exception on read if [applyStroke](#text-textdocument-textdocumentapplystroke) is not `true`.

#### Type

Array [r, g, b] of floating-point values; read/write.

---

### CharacterRange.strokeOverFill

`CharacterRange.strokeOverFill`

#### Description

The Text layer CharacterRange Stroke Over Fill character property.

Indicates the rendering order for the fill and stroke for characters in the range. When `true`, the stroke appears over the fill.

If this attribute has a mixed value, it will be read as `undefined`.

Warning

The Text layer can override per-character attribute setting via the All Strokes First or All Fills First setting on the CharPanel.

The value returned here represents what is applied to the characters, without regard to the possible Text layer override.

#### Type

Boolean; read/write.

---

### CharacterRange.text

`CharacterRange.text`

#### Description

The text value for the Text layer range.

On read, the same number of characters as the span of the range will be returned. If the span is zero (an insertion point) it return an empty string.

On write, the characters in the range will be replaced with whatever string value is supplied. If an empty string, then the characters in the range will be effectively deleted.

To insert characters without deleting any existing, call [TextDocument.characterRange()](#text-textdocument-textdocumentcharacterrange) with the same value for start as end to get an insertion point range.

#### Type

String; read/write.

---

## Methods

### CharacterRange.pasteFrom()

`CharacterRange.pasteFrom(characterRange)`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 25.1

#### Description

Copies, using paste semantics, from the `characterRange` parameter to the callee [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange-characterrange-object). The two instances may be the same, and the spans may be different.

Checks will be made that both [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange-characterrange-object) instances are valid.

The internal steps of the operation are:

* Delete the text from the target instance.
* Paste the text from the source instance.

As the span of the [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange-characterrange-object) is not adjusted by this call, when the source [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange-characterrange-object) instance has a shorter span than the target [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange-characterrange-object) instance, the target instance may become invalid.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `characterRange` | [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange-characterrange-object) | Object whose text and styling will be pasted in place of the callee [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange-characterrange-object). |

#### Returns

None.

---

### CharacterRange.toString()

`CharacterRange.toString()`

#### Description

Returns a string with the parameters used to create the CharacterRange instance, e.g. `"CharacterRange(0,-1)"`.

This may be safely called on an instance where isRangeValid returns `false`.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

String; read-only.

# ComposedLineRange object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).text.sourceText.value.composedLineRange(composedLineIndexStart, [signedComposedLineIndexEnd])`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.3

#### Description

The ComposedLineRange object is an accessor to a composed line range of the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) instance it was created from.

Composed lines are initialized in the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) when it is created and remain unchanged while the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) is changed.
It is important to note that the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) instance is not recomposed when changes are made to it - that only occurs when the instance is applied back to a [TextLayer object](#layer-textlayer).
So if you delete all the text in the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) instance the number of composed lines will remain constant.

* The [characterStart](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangecharacterstart) attribute will report the first character index of the range.
* The [characterEnd](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangecharacterend) attribute will report the (last + 1) character index of the range, such that ([characterEnd](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangecharacterend) - [characterStart](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangecharacterstart)) represents the number of characters in the range.
* A composed line always has some length.

When accessed, the ComposedLineRange object will check that effective [characterStart](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangecharacterend) of the range remains valid for the current span of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument). This is the same rule as applied when the ComposedLineRange was created, but because the length of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) can change through the addition or removal of characters, the effective [characterStart](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangecharacterend) may no longer be valid. In this situation an exception will be thrown on access, either read or write. The property [isRangeValid](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangeisrangevalid) will return `false` if the effective range is no longer valid.

Note that if the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) length changes, the character range could become valid again.

As a convenience, the function [ComposedLineRange.characterRange()](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangecharacterrange) can be invoked which will return a [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange) instance initialized from [characterStart](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangecharacterstart) and [characterEnd](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangecharacterend).
This instance becomes independent of the ComposedLineRange instance it came from so subsequent changes to the ComposedLineRange limits are not communicated to the [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange) instance.

For performance reasons, when accessing multiple attributes it is adviseable to retrieve the [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange) once and re-use it rather than create a new one each time.

#### Examples

This changes the fill color to red of the first composed line in the TextDocument, and set the rest of the lines to color blue.

```
var textDocument = app.project.item(index).layer(index).property("Source Text").value;

var composedLineRange0 = textDocument.composedLineRange(0,1);
var characterRange0 = composedLineRange0.characterRange();
characterRange0.fillColor = [1.0, 0, 0];

textDocument.composedLineRange(1,-1).characterRange().fillColor = [0, 0, 1.0];

```

# Font object

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.0

## Methods

### FontObject.hasGlyphsFor()

`app.fonts.allFonts[0][0].hasGlyphsFor(charString)`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 25.1

#### Description

Fonts do not contain glyphs for all possible ranges of Unicode and this method gives the caller the opportunity to query the Font about support for one or more characters.

Returns `true` if the font has a glyph for every character in the `charString`.

The character order does not matter, and in the case of a parameter string with more than one character, it is not possible though this API to determine which character had no glyph support.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `charString` | String | Text that will be checked for support in the [Font object](#text-fontobject-font-object). |

#### Returns

Boolean.

---

### FontObject.hasSameDict()

`app.fonts.fontsWithDefaultDesignAxes[0].hasSameDict(fontObject)`

#### Description

This function will `true` if the [Font object](#text-fontobject-font-object) passed as an argument shares the same variable font dictionary as the [Font object](#text-fontobject-font-object) the function is called on.

Tip

Can only return `true` when called on a variable [Font object](#text-fontobject-font-object) with the argument also being a [Font object](#text-fontobject-font-object) of a variable font.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fontObject` | [Font object](#text-fontobject-font-object) | Object to check |

#### Returns

Boolean.

---

### FontObject.postScriptNameForDesignVector()

`app.fonts.fontsWithDefaultDesignAxes[0].postScriptNameForDesignVector([...vectorValues])`

#### Description

This function will return the postscript name of the variable font for the specific design vectors passed as the argument.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vectorValues` | Array of floating-point values | Values to check [FontObject.designVector](#text-fontobject-fontobjectdesignvector) for the given variable font. |

#### Returns

A String.

# Fonts object

`app.fonts`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.0

#### Description

The Fonts objects provides information about the current font ecosystem on your device.

After Effects maintains an internal font proxy to a real font which it has enumerated in the font ecosystem. As the fonts in the font ecosystem are added and removed these internal font proxies are kept in sync as well by being added and removed.

The properties we report via the proxy [Font object](#text-fontobject) are the data that is available to us from the font files themselves, which of course will vary according to technology and type of font. It is not possible here to describe all the possible interesting variations and troubles that this causes us and in general it is advisable to be careful with assuming that the behavior and properties for one font type or technology are common to all other font types and technology - the answer as always is "it depends".

A [Font object](#text-fontobject) is a soft reference to one of these internal font proxies and as a consequence is not sufficient to keep the internal font proxy alive. As a result if the internal font proxy is removed, the referencing [Font object](#text-fontobject) will throw an invalid exception for any property reference.

On project open, and a few other situations, it may come to pass that the font which is being referenced in the persisted data cannot be found in the current font ecosystem. In these situations an internal font proxy will be created which will contain the desired properties, such as PostScript name, and will return `true` for [isSubstitute](#text-fontobject-fontobjectissubstitute). There will be an underlying real font which will be selected to support this internal font proxy, but we do not reveal what it is and there is no way to influence this selection.

Continuing the open process with created substitute fonts, an attempt will be made to sync matching fonts from Creative Cloud Adobe Fonts. This is an asynchronous activity and the project will usually finish opening and be ready for use before any fonts are brought down from Adobe Fonts. Depending on how many fonts are being synced, they may be installed at different times. There is no way to disable this attempt.

After any change to the font ecosystem from installing new real fonts, the outstanding list of substitute fonts will be evaluated to see if there now exists a real font which is a valid replacement for it - currently only requiring the PostScript name to match - and if one is found automatically all the references in the project to the substitute will be replaced with the newly installed font.

---

## Attributes

### FontsObject.allFonts

`app.fonts.allFonts`

#### Description

The list of all the fonts currently available on your system.

They are grouped into what is named a family group which are Arrays of [Font object](#text-fontobject).

The Family Name of the group is simply the [familyName](#text-fontobject-fontobjectfamilyname) of any of the [Font objects](#text-fontobject) in the group.

The Family Name in one font group is not guaranteed to have unique name compared to different font groups - the grouping is determined by a number of factors including the returned value of [FontObject.technology](#text-fontobject-fontobjecttechnology) and [FontObject.writingScripts](#text-fontobject-fontobjectwritingscripts).

In addition, it is perfectly acceptable to have multiple fonts with the same PostScript name, though only one will have the same (PostScript name, Technology, Primary Writing Script) tuple. In the case of true duplicates, it is undefined which will be returned and which will be suppressed.

The family groups and [Font objects](#text-fontobject) in the group are sorted according to the setting in the Character Panel dropdown "Show Font Names in English". If set to `true`, the [familyName](#text-fontobject-fontobjectfamilyname) and [styleName](#text-fontobject-fontobjectstylename) property is used, otherwise the [nativeFamilyName](#text-fontobject-fontobjectnativefamilyname) and [nativeStyleName](#text-fontobject-fontobjectnativestylename) property is used.

[Font object](#text-fontobject) for which [isSubstitute](#text-fontobject-fontobjectissubstitute) returns `true` are always sorted to the end as individual family groups.

#### Type

Array of Arrays of [Font objects](#text-fontobject); read-only.

#### Example

This example will select the first returned Font Family Array.

```
// Getting the first available Font Family Group on the system
var firstFontGroup = app.fonts.allFonts[0];

// Getting the first Style for that Font Family
var firstFontFamilyName = firstFontGroup[0].familyName;
var firstFamilyStyle = firstFontGroup[0].styleName;

alert(firstFontFamilyName+" "+firstFamilyStyle);

```

---

### FontsObject.favoriteFontFamilyList

`app.fonts.favoriteFontFamilyList`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.6

#### Description

Provides access to the Favorites list presented in the Character panel and Properties panel. To set the Favorites simply provide an (unsorted) array of strings based on the [familyName](#text-fontobject-fontobjectfamilyname). To clear the list simply assign an empty Array.

#### Type

Array of Strings; read/write.

---

### FontsObject.fontsDuplicateByPostScriptName

`app.fonts.fontsDuplicateByPostScriptName`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.6

#### Description

It is perfectly legal and common for more than one [Font object](#text-fontobject) to return the same value for [postScriptName](#text-fontobject-fontobjectpostscriptname) but as this can sometimes lead to confusion about what [Font object](#text-fontobject) will actually be used when using [TextDocument.font](#text-textdocument-textdocumentfont) or the `.font` attribute of a [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange), this property exists to both reveal what duplicates exist and also their relative order.

This returns an Array in which each element is an Array of [Font objects](#text-fontobject), where the 0th element [Font object](#text-fontobject) is considered the primary [Font object](#text-fontobject) for the given PostScript name.

#### Type

Array of Arrays of [Font Objects](#text-fontobject); read-only.

---

### FontsObject.fontServerRevision

`app.fonts.fontServerRevision`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.2

#### Description

Returns an unsigned number representing the current revision of the font environment.

The revision is advanced when anything happens to the font environment which would change the contents, properties, or order of [Font objects](#text-fontobject) returned from a call to [FontsObject.allFonts](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectallfonts).

Among these are: installing or removing fonts in the font environment, opening or closing a project with substituted fonts, causing a custom Variable font instance to be created, and changing the setting in the Character Panel dropdown "Show Font Names in English".

#### Type

Floating-point value; read-only.

#### Example

```
var fsRev = app.fonts.fontServerRevision;
alert(fsRev);

```

---

### FontsObject.fontsWithDefaultDesignAxes

`app.fonts.fontsWithDefaultDesignAxes`

#### Description

Returns an array of variable [Font objects](#text-fontobject), each using a unique font dictionary and with default values for their design axes. This API is a convenient way to quickly filter for a unique instance of each installed variable font.

#### Type

Array of [Font objects](#text-fontobject); read-only.

#### Example

```
var variableFontList = app.fonts.fontsWithDefaultDesignAxes;
alert(variableFontList.length);

```

---

### FontsObject.freezeSyncSubstitutedFonts

`app.fonts.freezeSyncSubstitutedFonts`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.6

#### Description

When a Project is opened and one or more fonts are not found in the local font environment, a *sync* process is initiated with Adobe Fonts to see if one or more Fonts could be activated and installed.

By default this happens automatically—this property will disable it from happening.

Warning

The rules for deciding if Adobe Fonts has a matching font is entirely based on the PostScript name. With some Variable Fonts, due to ambiguity about which font has which named instance, it is possible that more than one face (Regular/Italic) may be installed during an activation. Whether the installed font is a valid replacement is controlled by the [FontsObject.substitutedFontReplacementMatchPolicy](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectsubstitutedfontreplacementmatchpolicy).

#### Type

Boolean; read/write. One of:

* `false` is the default—sync from Adobe Fonts may be attempted.
* `true` means that no sync or install will be attempted.

---

### FontsObject.missingOrSubstitutedFonts

`app.fonts.missingOrSubstitutedFonts`

#### Description

The list of all the missing or substituted fonts of the current Project.

Tip

A substituted font is a font that was already missing when the project is opened. A missing font is a font that went missing (font being uninstalled, for example) *while* the project was open.

#### Type

Array of [Font objects](#text-fontobject); read-only.

---

### FontsObject.mruFontFamilyList

`app.fonts.mruFontFamilyList`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.6

#### Description

Provides access to the Most Recently Used (MRU) list presented in the Character panel and Properties panel. To set the MRU simply provide an (unsorted) array of strings based on the [familyName](#text-fontobject-fontobjectfamilyname). To clear the list simply assign an empty Array.

#### Type

Array of Strings; read/write.

---

### FontsObject.substitutedFontReplacementMatchPolicy

`app.fonts.substitutedFontReplacementMatchPolicy`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.6

#### Description

Controls the rules which are used to determine which fonts are considered matching for automatic replacement for a substituted [Font object](#text-fontobject).

#### Type

A `SubstitutedFontReplacementMatchPolicy` enumerated value; read/write. One of:

* `SubstitutedFontReplacementMatchPolicy.POSTSCRIPT_NAME` is the default; any [Font object](#text-fontobject) which has the same PostScript name is a valid candidate for replacement of a substituted [Font object](#text-fontobject).
* `SubstitutedFontReplacementMatchPolicy.CTFI_EQUAL` requires that the following properties of substituted [Font object](#text-fontobject) must match to be considered a valid candidate:
	+ [postScriptName](#text-fontobject-fontobjectpostscriptname)
	+ [technology](#text-fontobject-fontobjecttechnology)
	+ [writingScripts](#text-fontobject-fontobjectwritingscripts) (primary)
	+ [designVector](#text-fontobject-fontobjectdesignvector)
* `SubstitutedFontReplacementMatchPolicy.DISABLED` means that no [Font object](#text-fontobject) is an acceptable replacement for a the substituted [Font object](#text-fontobject).

---

## Methods

### FontsObject.getCTScriptForString()

`app.fonts.getCTScriptForString(charString, preferredCTScript)`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 25.1

#### Description

This function will return an array of generic objects describing the number of characters in the range and the `CTScript` enum assigned to them. See [FontObject.writingScripts](#text-fontobject-fontobjectwritingscripts) for a full list of `CTScript` enumerated values.

If a character is deemed to be included in one or more `CTScript` values, the value specfied in the second argument `preferredCTScript` will break the tie.

```
var scriptsV = app.fonts.getCTScriptForString("ABヂ", CTScript.CT_ROMAN_SCRIPT);
var str = "[0] chars:" + scriptsV[0].chars +   // 2
            " ctScript:" + getEnumAsString(scriptsV[0].ctScript) +
            "\n[1] chars:" + scriptsV[1].chars + // 1
            " ctScript:" + getEnumAsString(scriptsV[1].ctScript);
alert(str);

```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `charString` | String | Characters to check. If empty, will return an empty array. |
| `preferredCTScript` | `CTScript` enum | CT Script to prefer |

#### Returns

Array of generic objects;

* Key `chars` will be set to number of characters the in the range.
* Key `ctScript` will be set to the `CTScript` which applies to the characters in the range.

—

### FontsObject.getDefaultFontForCTScript()

`app.fonts.getDefaultFontForCTScript(ctScript)`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 25.1

#### Description

This function will return an instance of [Font object](#text-fontobject) mapped as the default font based on `CTScript`.

After Effects uses these mappings when typing or applying a font where it finds
that the font does not contain a glyph for the character.
In this situation it will attempt to map the character to a `CTScript` value
and then use this default mapping to select an alternate font which may have a
glyph for the character.

This mechanism is also used with text and fonts in Scripting thus providing a way
to expose which fonts will be used for which `CTScript` values.

There is no guarantee that what is returned will support all, or even any, of the
Unicode characters mapped to the `CTScript`.

```
var font = app.fonts.getDefaultFontForCTScript(CTScript.CT_JAPANESE_SCRIPT);

```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ctScript` | `CTScript` enum | Corresponding CTScript to get default font from. |

#### Returns

[Font object](#text-fontobject)

---

### FontsObject.getFontByID()

`app.fonts.getFontByID(fontID)`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.2

#### Description

This function will return an instance of [Font object](#text-fontobject) based on the ID of a previously found font.

If no matching font is found, it will return undefined. This can occur with an unknown ID or if the original font has been removed from the font environment.

```
var font1 = app.fonts.allFonts[0][0];
var font2 = app.fonts.getFontByID(font1.fontID);
alert(font1.fontID == font2.fontID);

```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fontID | Integer | The ID of the font. |

#### Returns

[Font object](#text-fontobject), or undefined if no font by that ID.

---

### FontsObject.getFontsByFamilyNameAndStyleName()

`app.fonts.getFontsByFamilyNameAndStyleName(familyName, styleName)`

#### Description

This function will return an array of [Font object](#text-fontobject) based on the Family Name and Style Name of a font. If no suitable font is found, it will return an empty Array.

Tip

The returned array length can be more than 1 if you have multiple copies of a same font.

```
var fontList = app.fonts.getFontsByFamilyNameAndStyleName("Abolition", "Regular")
alert(fontList.length);

```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FamilyName | String | The Family Name of the font. |
| StyleName | String | The Style Name of the font. |

#### Returns

Array of [Font objects](#text-fontobject); read-only.

---

### FontsObject.getFontsByPostScriptName()

`app.fonts.getFontsByPostScriptName(postscriptName)`

#### Description

This function will return an array of [Font objects](#text-fontobject) based on the PostScript name of previously found Fonts.

It is perfectly valid to have multiple [Font objects](#text-fontobject) which share the same PostScript name, the order of these is determined by the order in which they were enumerated in the font environment. The entry at `[0]` will be used when setting the [TextDocument.fontObject](#text-textdocument-textdocumentfontobject) property.

In addition, there is a special property of this API with regards to Variable fonts. If no [Font object](#text-fontobject) matching the requested PostScript exists, but we find that there exist a variable font which matches the requested PostScript name prefix, then this Variable font instance will be requested to create a matching [Font object](#text-fontobject). This is the only way that we will return an instance which did not exist prior to invoking this method.

If no matching font is found, it will return an empty Array.

```
var fontList = app.fonts.getFontsByPostScriptName("Abolition")
alert(fontList.length);

```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| postscriptName | String | The PostScript Name of the font. |

#### Returns

Array of [Font objects](#text-fontobject); read-only.

---

### FontsObject.pollForAndPushNonSystemFontFoldersChanges()

`app.fonts.pollForAndPushNonSystemFontFoldersChanges()`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.6

#### Description

The addition and removal of font files in what is considered the *system font folders* is recognized and handled automatically without user intervention to update the font environment. Non-system font folders are not automatically handled and so additions and removal of font files in these folders are not recognized until the After Effects is restarted.

This function will trigger a check against the known non-system font folders, and if it is recognized that there has been a change, an asynchronous update to the font environment will be scheduled to process this change.

The non-system font folders After Effects knows about are here:

```
Windows: <systemDrive>:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Fonts

Mac: /Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts

```

#### Returns

Boolean; One of:

* `false` if no changes to the font environment are known.
* `true` if a change in the font environment has been detected and an asynchronous update scheduled to deal with it. This state will be cleared once the update has been processed, at which time [FontsObject.fontServerRevision](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectfontserverrevision) will return an incremented value.

—

### FontsObject.setDefaultFontForCTScript()

`app.fonts.setDefaultFontForCTScript(ctScript, font)`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 25.1

#### Description

This function will set an instance of [Font object](#text-fontobject) mapped based on `CTScript` parameter.

After Effects uses these mappings when typing or applying a font where it finds
that the font does not contain a glyph for a given character.
In this situation it will attempt to map the character to a `CTScript` value
and then use this default mapping to select an alternate font which may have a glyph
for the character.

Variable fonts are not acceptable as defaults and will result in an exception being thrown.

There is no requirement that the specfied font has glyphs for any or all of the characters
mapped to the `CTScript`.

This mechanism is also used with text and fonts in Scripting thus providing a way
to expose which fonts will be used for which `CTScript` values (see [FontsObject.getDefaultFontForCTScript()](#text-fontsobject-fontsobjectgetdefaultfontforctscript)).

The font assigned to the `CTScript.CT_ROMAN_SCRIPT` is the one which is used to re-initialize the Character Panel after resetting the character style.

To reset the default for a specific `CTScript` back to the value it had at App launch, simply pass in `null`.

```
var font = app.fonts.getFontsByPostScriptName("MyriadPro-Regular")[0];
var ret = app.fonts.setDefaultFontForCTScript(CTScript.CT_ROMAN_SCRIPT, font);
alert("set:" + ret);

```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ctScript` | `CTScript` enum | CTScript for font to be mapped |
| `font` | [Font object](#text-fontobject) | The font to be mapped. If `null`, then current mapping is reset. |

#### Returns

Boolean; One of:

* `false` if the specfied mapping is the same the current one.
* `true` if the specified mapping is different from the current one.
# ParagraphRange object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).text.sourceText.value.paragraphRange(paragraphIndexStart, [signedParagraphIndexEnd])`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.3

#### Description

The ParagraphRange object is an accessor to a paragraph range of the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) instance it was created from.

* The [characterStart](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterstart) attribute will report the first character index of the range.
* The [characterEnd](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterend) attribute will report the (last + 1) character index of the range, such that ([characterEnd](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterend) - [characterStart](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterstart)) represents the number of characters in the range.
* The only time these two properties will equal will on an empty last paragraph of the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument).

When accessed, the ParagraphRange object will check that effective [characterStart](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterend) of the range remains valid for the current span of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument). This is the same rule as applied when the ParagraphRange was created, but because the length of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) can change through the addition or removal of characters, the effective [characterStart](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterend) may no longer be valid. In this situation an exception will be thrown on access, either read or write. The [isRangeValid](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangeisrangevalid) attribute will return `false` if the effective range is no longer valid.

Note that if the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument) length changes, the character range could become valid again.

As a convenience, the function [ParagraphRange.characterRange()](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterrange) can be invoked which will return a [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange) instance initialized from [characterStart](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterstart) and [characterEnd](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterend).
This instance becomes independent of the ParagraphRange instance it came from so subsequent changes to the ParagraphRange limits are not communicated to the [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange) instance.

For performance reasons, when accessing multiple attributes it is adviseable to retrieve the [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange) once and re-use it rather than create a new one each time.

#### Examples

This increases the font size of the first paragraph in the TextDocument, and set the rest of the paragraphs to fontSize 40.

```
var textDocument = app.project.item(index).layer(index).property("Source Text").value;

var paragraphRange0 = textDocument.paragraphRange(0,1);
var characterRange0 = paragraphRange0.characterRange();
characterRange0.fontSize = characterRange0.fontSize + 5;

textDocument.paragraphRange(1,-1).characterRange().fontSize = 40;

```

---

## Attributes

### ParagraphRange.characterEnd

`ParagraphRange.characterEnd`

#### Description

The Text layer range calculated character end value.

Throws an exception on access if the effective value would exceed the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument).

#### Type

Unsigned integer; read-only.

---

### ParagraphRange.characterStart

`ParagraphRange.characterStart`

#### Description

The Text layer range calculated character start value.

Throws an exception on access if the effective value would exceed the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument).

#### Type

Unsigned integer; read-only.

---

### ParagraphRange.isRangeValid

`ParagraphRange.isRangeValid`

#### Description

Returns `true` if the current range is within the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument), otherwise `false`.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

## Methods

### ParagraphRange.characterRange()

`ParagraphRange.characterRange()`

#### Description

Returns a [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange) initialized from [characterStart](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterstart) and [characterEnd](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangecharacterend).

Will throw an exception if [isRangeValid](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangeisrangevalid) would return `false`.

The returned instance, once created, is independent of subsequent changes to the ParagraphRange it came from.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

[CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange);

---

### ParagraphRange.toString()

`ParagraphRange.toString()`

#### Description

Returns a string with the parameters used to create the ParagraphRange instance, e.g. `"ParagraphRange(0,-1)"`

This may be safely called on an instance where [isRangeValid](#text-paragraphrange-paragraphrangeisrangevalid) returns `false`.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

String;

# TextDocument object

`new TextDocument(docText)`

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).property("Source Text").value`

#### Description

The TextDocument object stores a value for a TextLayer's Source Text property. Create it with the constructor, passing the string to be encapsulated.

#### Examples

This sets a value of some source text and displays an alert showing the new value.

```
var myTextDocument = new TextDocument("HappyCake");
myTextLayer.property("Source Text").setValue(myTextDocument);
alert(myTextLayer.property("Source Text").value);

```

This sets keyframe values for text that show different words over time

```
var textProp = myTextLayer.property("Source Text");
textProp.setValueAtTime(0, newTextDocument("Happy"));
textProp.setValueAtTime(.33, newTextDocument("cake"));
textProp.setValueAtTime(.66, newTextDocument("is"));
textProp.setValueAtTime(1, newTextDocument("yummy!"));

```

This sets various character and paragraph settings for some text

```
var textProp = myTextLayer.property("Source Text");
var textDocument = textProp.value;
myString = "Happy holidays!";
textDocument.resetCharStyle();
textDocument.fontSize = 60;
textDocument.fillColor = [1, 0, 0];
textDocument.strokeColor = [0, 1, 0];
textDocument.strokeWidth = 2;
textDocument.font = "Times New Roman PSMT";
textDocument.strokeOverFill = true;
textDocument.applyStroke = true;
textDocument.applyFill = true;
textDocument.text = myString;
textDocument.justification = ParagraphJustification.CENTER_JUSTIFY;
textDocument.tracking = 50;
textProp.setValue(textDocument);

```

---

## Attributes

### TextDocument.allCaps

`textDocument.allCaps`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 13.2 (CC 2014.2)

#### Description

`true` if a Text layer has All Caps enabled; otherwise `false`. To set this value, use [fontCapsOption](#text-textdocument-textdocumentfontcapsoption) added in After Effects 24.0.

Warning

This value only reflects the first character in the Text layer.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### TextDocument.applyFill

`textDocument.applyFill`

#### Description

This value only reflects the first character in the Text layer.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### TextDocument.superscript

`textDocument.superscript`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 13.2 (CC 2014.2)

#### Description

`true` if a Text layer has superscript enabled; otherwise `false`. To set this value, use [TextDocument.fontBaselineOption](#text-textdocument-textdocumentfontbaselineoption) added in After Effects 24.0.

Warning

This value only reflects the first character in the Text layer.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### TextDocument.text

`textDocument.text`

#### Description

The text value for the Text layer's Source Text property.

#### Type

String; read/write.

---

### TextDocument.tracking

`textDocument.tracking`

#### Description

The Text layer's spacing between characters.

Warning

This value only reflects the first character in the Text layer.

If you change this value, it will set all characters in the Text layer to the specified setting.

#### Type

Floating-point value; read/write.

---

### TextDocument.tsume

`textDocument.tsume`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 13.2 (CC 2014.2)

#### Description

This Text layer's tsume value as a normalized percentage, from 0.0 -> 1.0.

Warning

This value only reflects the first character in the Text layer.

If you change this value, it will set all characters in the Text layer to the specified setting.

This attribute accepts values from 0.0 -> 100.0, however the value IS expecting a normalized value from 0.0 -> 1.0. Using a value higher than 1.0 will produce unexpected results; AE's Character Panel will clamp the value at 100%, despite the higher value set by scripting (ie `TextDocument.tsume = 100` \_really\_ sets a value of 10,000%)

#### Type

Floating-point value; read-write.

---

### TextDocument.verticalScale

`textDocument.verticalScale`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 13.2 (CC 2014.2)

#### Description

## Methods

### TextDocument.characterRange()

`textDocument.characterRange(characterStart, [signedCharacterEnd])`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.3

#### Description

Returns an instance of the Text layer range accessor CharacterRange.

The instance will remember the parameters passed in the constructor - they remain constant and changes to the [TextDocument](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object) length may cause the instance to throw exceptions on access until the [TextDocument](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object) length is changed to a length which makes the range valid again.

Use toString() to find out what the constructed parameters were.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `characterStart` | Unsigned integer | Starts at zero, must be the less than or equal to the (text) length of the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object). |
| `signedCharacterEnd` | Signed integer. | Optional. If not specified, will be computed at `(characterStart + 1)`.  If set to `-1`, then the [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange) will dynamically calculate this on access to be equal to the (text) length of the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object).  `signedCharacterEnd` must be greater than or equal to `characterStart`, and less than or equal to the (text) length of the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object). |

Throws an exception if the parameters would result in an invalid range.

It is not possible to create a [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange) which spans the final carriage return in the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object).

#### Returns

An instance of [CharacterRange object](#text-characterrange)

---

### TextDocument.composedLineCharacterIndexesAt()

`textDocument.composedLineCharacterIndexesAt(characterIndex)`

Note

This functionality was added in After Effects 24.3

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `characterIndex` | Unsigned integer | A text index in the Text layer, which will be mapped to the composed line it intersects. |

#### Returns

Generic object;
Key `start` will be set to text index of the start of the composed line (greater than or equal to zero).
Key `end` will be set to text index of the end of the composed line (greater than start, or equal to start if it is the last composed line).

Will throw an exception if the computed start and end are outside of the current [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object)
Remember that the composed lines are static and subsequent changes to the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object) instance which changes its length may render the composed line data invalid.

---

### TextDocument.composedLineRange()

The instance will remember the parameters passed in the constructor - they remain constant and changes to the [TextDocument](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object) contents may cause the instance to throw exceptions on access until the [TextDocument](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object) contents are changed which makes the range valid again.

Use [ComposedLineRange.toString()](#text-composedlinerange-composedlinerangetostring) to find out what the constructed parameters were.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `composedLineIndexStart` | Unsigned integer | Starts at zero, must be the less than the number of composed lines in the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object). |
| `signedComposedLineIndexEnd` | Signed integer. | Optional. If not specified, will be computed at `(composedLineIndexStart + 1)`.  If set to -1, then the [ComposedLineRange object](#text-composedlinerange) will dynamically calculate this on access to the last composed line of the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object).  `signedComposedLineIndexEnd` must be greater than `composedLineIndexStart`, and less than or equal to the number of composed lines in the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object). |

Throws an exception if the parameters would result in an invalid range.

Remember that the composed lines are static and subsequent changes to the [TextDocument object](#text-textdocument-textdocument-object) instance which changes its length may render the composed line data invalid.

#### Returns

An instance of [ComposedLineRange object](#text-composedlinerange)

# KeyframeEase object

`myKey = new KeyframeEase(speed, influence);`

#### Description

The KeyframeEase object encapsulates the keyframe ease settings of a layer's AE property. Keyframe ease is determined by the speed and influence values that you set using the property's [setTemporalEaseAtKey](#property-property-propertysettemporaleaseatkey) method. The constructor creates a KeyframeEase object. Both parameters are required.

* `speed`: A floating-point value. Sets the `speed` attribute.
* `influence`: A floating-pointvalue in the range `[0.1..100.0]`. Sets the `influence` attribute.

#### Example

This example assumes that the Position, a spatial property, has more than two keyframes.

```
var easeIn = new KeyframeEase(0.5, 50);
var easeOut = new KeyframeEase(0.75, 85);
var myPositionProperty = app.project.item(1).layer(1).property("Position");
myPositionProperty.setTemporalEaseAtKey(2, [easeIn], [easeOut]);

```

This example sets the Scale, a temporal property with either two or three dimensions. For 2D and 3D properties you must set an `easeIn` and `easeOut` value for each dimension:

```
var easeIn = new KeyframeEase(0.5, 50);
var easeOut = new KeyframeEase(0.75, 85);
var myScaleProperty = app.project.item(1).layer(1).property("Scale")
myScaleProperty.setTemporalEaseAtKey(2, [easeIn, easeIn, easeIn], [easeOut, easeOut, easeOut]);

```

---

## Attributes

### KeyframeEase.influence

#### Type

Floating-point value, in the range `[0.1..100.0]`; read/write.

---

### KeyframeEase.speed

`myKey.speed`

#### Description

The speed value of the keyframe. The units depend on the type of keyframe, and are displayed in the Keyframe Velocity dialog box.

#### Type

Floating-point value; read/write.

# MarkerValue object

`new MarkerValue(comment, chapter, url, frameTarget, cuePointName, params)`

#### Description

The MarkerValue object represents a layer or composition marker, which associates a comment, and optionally a chapter reference point, Web-page link, or Flash Video cue point with a particular point in a layer.

Create it with the constructor; all arguments except `comment` are optional.

All arguments are strings that set in the corresponding attributes of the returned MarkerValue object, except `params`; this is an array containing key-value pairs, which can then be accessed with the [getParameters()](#other-markervalue-markervaluegetparameters) and [setParameters()](#other-markervalue-markervaluesetparameters) methods.

A script can set any number of parameter pairs; the order does not reflect the order displayed in the application.

To associate a marker with a layer, set the MarkerValue object in the [Layer.marker](#layer-layer-layermarker) property of the layer: `layerObject.property("Marker").setValueAtTime(time, markerValueObject);`

To associate a marker with a composition, set the MarkerValue object in the [CompItem.markerProperty](#item-compitem-compitemmarkerproperty) property of the comp: `compObject.markerProperty.setValueAtTime(time, markerValueObject);`

For information on the usage of markers see "Using markers" in After Effects Help.

#### Examples

* To set a **layer** marker that says "Fade Up" at the 2 second mark:
 
```
var myMarker = new MarkerValue("FadeUp");
myLayer.property("Marker").setValueAtTime(2, myMarker);
// or
myLayer.marker.setValueAtTime(2, myMarker);

```
* To set a **comp** marker that says "Fade Up" at the 2 second mark:
 
```
var myMarker = new MarkerValue("FadeUp");
comp.markerProperty.setValueAtTime(2, myMarker);

```
* To get comment values from a particular marker:
 
```
var layer = app.project.item(1).layer(1);
var markerProperty = layer.marker;

var commentOfFirstMarker = markerProperty.keyValue(1).comment;

// or
var commentOfMarkerAtTime4 = markerProperty.valueAtTime(4.0, true).comment;

// or
var markerValueAtTimeClosestToTime4 = markerProperty.keyValue(markerProperty.nearestKeyIndex(4.0));
var commentOfMarkerClosestToTime4 = markerValueAtTimeClosestToTime4.comment;

```

# Preferences object

`app.preferences`

#### Description

The Preferences object provides an easy way to manage internal AE preferences, such as you'd find in AE's Preferences menu. These are saved in the After Effects preference files, and are persistent between application sessions.

Preferences are identified by section and key within the file, and each key name is associated with a value.

In the preferences file, section names are enclosed in brackets and quotation marks, and key names are listing in quotation marks below the sectionname. All values are strings.

You can create new preferences with this object, as well as accessing existing preferences.

As of Version 12/CC, preferences and settings methods now take a third argument to specify the target preferences file if Section/Key is not in "Adobe After Effects $versionNumber.x Prefs.txt".

If the third argument is not passed, default value (`PREFType.PREF_Type_MACHINE_SPECIFIC`) is used and After Effects tries to save/get from the "Adobe After Effects $versionNumber.x Prefs.txt" preferences file.

#### PREFType Enum

The third argument is enum `PREFType` value, one of:

* `PREF_Type_MACHINE_SPECIFIC`: Adobe After Effects $versionNumber.x Prefs.txt
* `PREF_Type_MACHINE_INDEPENDENT`: Adobe After Effects $versionNumber.x Prefs-indep-general.txt
* `PREF_Type_MACHINE_INDEPENDENT_RENDER`: Adobe After Effects $versionNumber.x Prefs-indep-render.txt
* `PREF_Type_MACHINE_INDEPENDENT_OUTPUT`: Adobe After Effects $versionNumber.x Prefs-indep-output.txt
* `PREF_Type_MACHINE_INDEPENDENT_COMPOSITION`: Adobe After Effects $versionNumber.x Prefs-indep-composition.txt
* `PREF_Type_MACHINE_SPECIFIC_TEXT`: Adobe After Effects $versionNumber.x Prefs-text.txt
* `PREF_Type_MACHINE_SPECIFIC_PAINT`: Adobe After Effects $versionNumber.x Prefs-paint.txt

# Settings object

`app.settings`

#### Description

The Settings object provides an easy way to manage settings for third-party scripts. The settings are saved in the main After Effects preferences file, and are persistent between application sessions.

Settings are identified by section and key within the file, and each key name is associated with a value.

In the settings file, section names are enclosed in brackets and quotation marks, and key names are listing in quotation marks below the sectionname. All values are strings.

You can create new settings with this object, as well as accessing existing settings.

As of Version 12/CC, preferences and settings methods now take a third argument to specify the target preferences file if Section/Key is not in the main preferences file. See [Preferences object](#other-preferences) for more info.

Tip

* These values aren't shared between versions of AE; each new install brings new settings files, and so these prefs won't carry over.
* Internally, all saved settings have their section name preprended with `"Settings_"`
* If you're looking to get or set internal AE preferences, see [Preferences object](#other-preferences)

---

## Methods

### Settings.getSetting()

`app.settings.getSetting(sectionName, keyName[, prefType])`

#### Description

Retrieves a script settings item value from the preferences file.

Warning

If the value is greater than 1999 bytes, `getSetting` that item will throw an error (seen in AE 15.0.1)

# Shape object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).property(index).property("maskShape").value`

#### Description

The Shape object encapsulates information describing a shape in a shape layer, or the outline shape of a Mask. It is the value of the "Mask Path" AE properties, and of the "Path" AE property of a shape layer. Use the constructor, `new Shape()`, to create a new, empty Shape object, then set the attributes individually to define the shape.

A shape has a set of anchor points, or vertices, and a pair of direction handles, or tangent vectors, for each anchor point. A tangent vector (in a non-RotoBezier mask) determines the direction of the line that is drawn to or from an anchor point. There is one incoming tangent vector and one outgoing tangent vector associated with each vertex in the shape.

A tangent value is a pair of x,y coordinates specified relative to the associated vertex. For example, a tangent of [-1,-1] is located above and to the left of the vertex and has a 45 degree slope, regardless of the actual location of the vertex. The longer a handle is, the greater its influence; for example, an incoming shape segment stays closer to the vector for an `inTangent` of [-2,-2] than it does for an `inTangent` of [-1,-1], even though both of these come toward the vertex from the same direction.

If a shape is not closed, the `inTangent` for the first vertex and the `outTangent` for the final vertex are ignored. If the shape is closed, these two vectors specify the direction handles of the final connecting segment out of the final vertex and back into the first vertex.

RotoBezier masks calculate their tangents automatically. (See [MaskPropertyGroup.rotoBezier](#property-maskpropertygroup-maskpropertygrouprotobezier)) If a shape is used in a RotoBezier mask, the tangent values are ignored. This means that, for RotoBezier masks, you can construct a shape by setting only the `vertices` attribute and setting both `inTangents` and `outTangents` to `null`. When you access the new shape, its tangent values are filled with the automatically calculated tangent values.

For closed mask shapes, variable-width mask feather points can exist anywhere along the mask path. Feather points are part of the Mask Path property. Reference a specific feather point by the number of the mask path segment (portion of the path between adjacent vertices) where it appears.

Tip

The feather points on a mask are listed in an array in the order that they were created.

#### Examples

* Create a square mask. A square is a closed shape with 4 vertices. The `inTangents` and `outTangents` for connected straight-line segments are 0, the default, and do not need to be explicitly set.
 
```
var myShape = new Shape();
myShape.vertices = [[0,0], [0,100], [100,100], [100,0]];
myShape.closed = true;

```
* Create a "U" shaped mask. A "U" is an open shape with the same 4 vertices used in the square.
 
```
var myShape = new Shape();
myShape.vertices = [[0,0], [0,100], [100,100], [100,0]];
myShape.closed = false;

```
* Create an oval. An oval is a closed shape with 4 vertices and with inTangent and outTangent values.
 
```
var myShape = new Shape();
myShape.vertices = [[300,50], [200,150],[300,250],[400,150]];
myShape.inTangents = [[55.23,0],[0,-55.23],[-55.23,0],[0,55.23]];
myShape.outTangents = [[-55.23,0],[0,55.23],[55.23,0],[0,-55.23]];
myShape.closed = true;

```
* Create a square mask with two feather points. A large square mask with two feather points, one closer to the left end the second mask segment (off the bottom edge) with a radius of 30 pixels and the other one centered the third mask segment (off the right edge) with a larger radius of 100 pixels.
 
```
var myShape = new Shape();
myShape.vertices = [[100,100], [100,400], [400,400], [400,100]]; // segments drawn counter clockwise
myShape.closed = true;
myShape.featherSegLocs = [1, 2]; // segments are numbered starting at 0, so second segment is 1
myShape.featherRelSegLocs = [0.15, 0.5]; // 0.15 is closer to the lower-left corner of the square
myShape.featherRadii = [30, 100]; // second feather point (onright-sidesegment) has a larger radius

```
